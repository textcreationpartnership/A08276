         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Thus (dearely beloved in the Lord) haue I briefly run over the expoſition of this firſt verſe, let me now vpon it build ſome doctrine, for the building vp of our ſelues in our holy faith. you will bee pleaſed to remember with mee, that <hi>Amos</hi> of a <hi>heardmen</hi> or a <hi>ſhepheard</hi> became a bleſſed <hi>Prophet</hi> to carry a terrible <hi>word,</hi> &amp; fearefull meſſage from the living God, to the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1729:9"/> King, Nobles, Prieſts, and people of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> The doctrine to be grounded herevpon, I deliver in this propoſition;
<q>God chooſeth vile and deſpiſed perſons, to confound the great and mightie.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Vile, and deſpiſed perſons, I call ſuch, as to the world, to humane wiſdome, and to the eye of reaſon are of no price, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme, or worth. Such as <hi>Ioſeph</hi> was, when hee kept ſheepe in <hi>Canaan</hi> with his brethren, and was by them ſold to the <hi>Iſmae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites.</hi> Gen. 37.2, 27. Such as Moſes was, when firſt he was caſt into the flags Exod. 2.1. Such as <hi>David</hi> was while he medled with ſheepfolds, and followed the ewes great with you<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g. Pſal. 78.70. Such as were <hi>Peter, Andrew, Iames,</hi> &amp; <hi>Iohn</hi> while they buſied themſelues about mending of nets, and catching of fiſh Matth. 4.18, 21. Theſe, <hi>Ioſeph, Moſes,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> ſhepheards, <hi>Peter, Andrew, Iames,</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> fiſhermen, vile and deſpiſed in the accompt of the world, were choſen by the wiſdome of the great God of heaven, one to be a ruler in Egypt; another to be a leader of Gods people, the third to be a King; the reſt to be Chriſts Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>Heare now a word of eternall veritie and full of comfort. You ſhall find it Pſal. 113.7, 8. The Lord who is high aboue al nations, and glorious aboue the heavens, <hi>hee raiſeth the needy out of the duſt, and lifteth vp the poore out of the dung, to ſet him with Princes. S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Pauls</hi> diſcourſe touching this point is more large and ſpacious. You ſhall find it 1. Cor. 1.27, 28. <hi>God hath choſen the fooliſh things of this world to confound the wiſe, &amp; the weake things to confound the ſtrong, and vile things, &amp; things despiſed, and things which are not, to bring to naught the things that are.</hi> The reaſon of Gods dealing thus in the advancement of the fooliſh, weake, vile, deſpiſed, needy and poore to places of dignitie, is expreſſed 1. Cor. 1.29. It is, <hi>that no fleſh ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioice in his preſence,</hi> that is, that no man ſhould glory before the Lord. In this reaſon are two things, worthy our religious conſiderations, as <hi>Muſculus</hi> well obſerveth. For hereby our God, firſt ſuppreſſeth and beateth downe the pride of fleſh, &amp; takes from it all glory of wiſdome, power and nobilitie; and ſecondly, whatſoever glory there is of wiſdome, power &amp; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1729:10"/> he doth claime and challenge it for his owne peculiar. Thus haue you (dearely beloved) the confirmation of my do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. The doctrine was:
<q>God chooſeth vile and deſpiſed perſons, to confound the great and mightie.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Be patient, I beſeech you, while I point at ſome vſes of it.</p>
            <p>The firſt vſe is, to lift vp our mindes to the contemplation of Gods good <hi>providence.</hi> Poore ſhepheards and fiſhermen God exalteth and advanceth into the higheſt places of digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in Church and common-wealth. Hereby wee knowe that neither <hi>Empire,</hi> nor <hi>Kingdome,</hi> nor <hi>place</hi> in them of dignitie, prioritie, or preeminence, Eccleſiaſticall or politique, is gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the induſtrie, wiſedome, wit, or ſtrength of man: but that all are adminiſtred, ruled, and governed by the deputation and ordination of the higheſt power, God almightie.</p>
            <p>A ſecond vſe is to ſtop blaſphemous mouthes, ſuch as are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vermore open againſt heaven, with<note n="i" place="margin">Cic. de nat. Deor.</note> 
               <hi>Epicurus,</hi> and<note n="k" place="margin">Cic. ibid.</note> 
               <hi>Diagoras,</hi> and their adherents, to affirme that the God of heaven, in as much as he is abſolutely bleſſed, is not to trouble himſelfe with cares for this lower world: that it ſtandeth not with Gods maieſtie to care for the vile, abiect, and deſpiſed things of this world. This impious rabble, and Sathans brood, doe think that all things below the moone are ruled by their blind Goddeſſe <hi>Fortune</hi> and by <hi>Chance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Heere muſt I beſeech you, to let your hearts bee ioined with mine in the conſideration of God his ſweet, &amp; never ſleeping <hi>care</hi> and <hi>providence</hi> over this lower world.</p>
            <p>Let vs not ſuppoſe our <hi>God,</hi> to be a <hi>God</hi> to halfes and in part only; a <hi>God</hi> aboue, and not beneath the moone: a <hi>God</hi> vpon the mountaines, and not in the vallies; a <hi>God</hi> in the greater &amp; not in the leſſer employments. The holy ſcriptures doe teach vs, that our God examineth the leſt moments and titles in the world, that we can imagin, to a<note n="l" place="margin">1 King. 17.14.</note> handfull of meale; to a<note n="m" place="margin">Ibid.</note> cruſe of oyle in a poore widdows houſe, to the falling of<note n="n" place="margin">Matth. 10.29.</note> ſparrows to the ground, to the<note n="o" place="margin">Matth. 6.26.</note> feeding of the birds of the aire, to the<note n="p" place="margin">Pſal. 29.9.</note> calving of hinds: to the<note n="q" place="margin">Matth. 6.30</note> clothing of the graſſe of the field; to

Why then are wee troubled with the vaine conceits of luck, fortune, or chance? Why will any man ſay? this fell vnto mee by good lucke, or by ill lucke? by good fortune, or by misfortune? by good chance, or by miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance?</p>
            <p>We may and ſhould know, that in the courſe of Gods <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> all things are determined and regular. This is a ſure ground: we may build vpon it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>fiſh</hi> that came to devour <hi>Ionas,</hi> may ſeeme to haue arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in that place by chance; yet the ſcripture ſaith, <hi>the Lorde had prepared a great fiſh to ſwallow</hi> Ionas, <hi>Ion.</hi> 1.17.</p>
            <p>The <hi>ſtorme</hi> it ſelfe which droue the pilots to this ſtreight, may likewiſe ſeeme contingent to the glimſe of carnall eies; yet the prophet ſaith, <hi>I know that for my ſake this great tempeſt is vpon you.</hi> Ion. 1.12.</p>
            <p>The fiſh which <hi>Peter</hi> tooke might ſeeme to haue come to the angle by chance, yet he brought in his mouth <hi>the tribute</hi> which <hi>Peter</hi> paid for his <hi>Lord</hi> and for <hi>himſelfe.</hi> Mat. 17.27.</p>
            <p>By the diverſity of the opinions among the brethren tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the manner of diſpatching <hi>Ioſeph</hi> out of the way, we may gather, that the ſelling of him into Egypt, was but accidentall, &amp; only agreed; vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by reaſon of the fit arrival of the mercha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts while they were diſputing and debating what they were beſt to do: yet ſaith <hi>Ioſeph</hi> vnto his brethren: <hi>you ſent me not hither, but God.</hi> Gen. 45.8.</p>
            <p>What may ſeeme more contingent in our eies, then by the glancing of an arrow from the common marke, to ſtrike a tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailer that paſſeth by the way: yet God himſelfe is ſaid to <hi>haue delivered the man into the hand</hi> of the ſhooter, <hi>Exod.</hi> 21.13.</p>
            <p>Some may think it hard fortune, that <hi>Achab</hi> was ſo ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made away, becauſe a certaine man having bent his bow, &amp; let ſlip his arrow at hap hazard, without aime at any certaine marke,<note n="t" place="margin">1. King 22.34.</note> ſtrooke the King: but here wee finde no lucke, nor chance at all, otherwiſe, then in reſpect of vs, for that the ſhoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter did no more, then was denounced to the King by <hi>Micheas</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:1729:11"/> from Gods owne mouth before the battaile was begunne, 1. <hi>King.</hi> 22.17.</p>
            <p>What in the world can be more caſuall then lottery? yet <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> teacheth that when the <hi>lots are caſt into the lap,</hi> the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God <hi>dispoſeth them,</hi> Prov. 16.33.</p>
            <p>See now, and acknowledge with me the large extent of Gods good providence. Though his dwelling be on high, yet abaſeth he himſelfe to behold vs below. From his good provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence it is, that this day we are here met togither, I to preach the word of God, you to heare it, &amp; ſome of vs to be made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the bleſſed body and bloud of our Lord and Saviour <hi>Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> Let vs poure out our ſouls in thankfulneſſe before God for this his bleſſing.</p>

               <item>2 Concerning his former condition of life. <hi>He was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the heardmen:</hi> that is, hee was a heardman or ſhepheard.</item>
               <item>3 Of the place of his vſuall abode: <hi>At Tekoa;</hi> a litle vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage in the confines of the kingdome of <hi>Iuda,</hi> beyond which there was not ſo much as a little cottage: onely there was a great wilderneſſe, called 2. <hi>Chr.</hi> 20.20. <hi>the wilderneſſe of Tekoa:</hi> a fit place for a ſhepheards walke.</item>
               <item>4 About the matter or argument of this prophecie, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed in theſe worder: <hi>The words which he ſaw vpon Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</hi> Then you heard that <hi>Amos</hi> was by the holy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit deputed and directed with his meſſage peculiarly, and properly to the 10. revolted tribes, the kingdome of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>

               <item>5 Of the time of the prophecie, which I told you, was ſet downe in that verſe <hi>generally</hi> and <hi>specially.</hi>

                     <item>1 Generally; In <hi>the daies of</hi> Vzziah <hi>king of</hi> Iuda, <hi>and in the daies of</hi> Ieroboam <hi>the ſonne of</hi> Ioaſh <hi>king of</hi> Iſrael.</item>

            <p>After my expoſition given vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe fiue parts of that text, I recald to your remembrances, that <hi>Amos</hi> of a heardman, or ſhepheard, became a bleſſed prophet, to carry a terrible word
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:1729:12"/> and fearefull meſſage from the living God to the king, nobles, prieſts, and people of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Therevpon I commended to you this doctrine.</p>
            <q>God chooſeth vile and despiſed perſons to condemne the great and mightie.</q>
            <p>That doctrine proved, I recommended to you the vſes of it. The firſt was to lift vp your mindes to the contemplation of Gods good providence. Poore ſhepheards and fiſhermen God exalteth and advanceth into the higheſt places of dignitie in church and common wealth. This might perſwade you that neither empire nor kingdome, nor place in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of dignity, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority or preeminence, eccleſiaſticall or politique, is gotten by the induſtrie, wiſdome, wit, or ſtrength of man, but that all are adminiſtred, ruled, and governed by the deputation, and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the higheſt power <hi>God almightie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond was to ſtop blaſphemous mouthes ſuch as are ever more open againſt the God of Heaven, to affirme, that all things belowe the moone are ruled by their blinde Goddeſſe <hi>fortune</hi> and by <hi>chance.</hi> Here my deſire was, that your heartes might be ioined with mine in the conſideration of Gods moſt ſweet &amp; never ſleeping care over vs in this lower world: that we would not ſuppoſe our God, to be a God to halfes and in part only, a God aboue and not beneath the moone, a God in the greater and not in the leſſer employments.</p>
            <p>To this holy meditation I exhorted you, taught by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſcriptures, that our God examineth the leſt moments, &amp; ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles in the world, that you can imagine; to a handful of meal, to a cruſe of oile in a poore widdowes houſe; to the falling of the Sparrows to the ground; to the feeding of the birds of the aire; to the calving of Hindes; to the cloathing of the graſſe, of the field; to the numbring of the haires of our heads; to the trick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of teares downe our cheekes. Thus farre as Gods holie ſpirit aſſiſted me, I led you the laſt time. Now let it pleaſe you with patience and reverence to giue eare to the word of God as it followeth, ver. 2.</p>
            <q>And hee ſaid: The Lord ſhall roare from <hi>Sion,</hi> and vtter his
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:1729:13"/> voice fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> and the dwelling places of the ſhepheards ſhall periſh and the top of <hi>Carmel</hi> ſhall wither.</q>
            <p>In this verſe I commend vnto you two generall parts:

                  <item>1 A preface to a prophecie: <hi>And he ſaid.</hi>

                  </item>
               </list> In the prophecie, I muſt further commend vnto you 3. things:
<list>
                  <item>1 The Lord ſpeaking: <hi>He ſhall roare and vtter forth his voice.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2 The place, from whence he ſpeaketh: <hi>from Sion</hi> and <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3 The ſequels of his ſpeech. They are two;

                        <item>1 Deſolation to the dwelling places of the ſhepheards: <hi>The dwelling places of the ſhepheards ſhall periſh.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2 Sterility and barrenneſſe to their fruitfull grounds: <hi>The top of</hi> Carmel <hi>ſhall wither.</hi>

                     </list>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt generall part, the preface to the prophecie I muſt firſt ſpeake vnto. <hi>And he ſaid.] He,</hi> that is, <hi>Amos: Amos</hi> the heardma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or ſhepheard, whoſe dwelling was at <hi>Tekoa. He ſaid;</hi> what ſaid he? Even the <hi>words which he ſaw vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi> Iſrael, that is, he ſpake the words of God committed to him, by that kinde of propheticall inſtinct and motion which is commonly tearmed <hi>viſion:</hi> the words of God, which were diſcloſed or reveiled vnto him in a <hi>viſion; Amos</hi> ſpake; but his words were <hi>Gods</hi> words.</p>
            <p>Here (dearely beloved) wee may learne whence the holy ſcriptures haue their ſoveraigne authoritie. Their authoritie is fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aboue, eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from the LORD, whoſe name is IEHOVAH, whoſe<note n="a" place="margin">Matth. 5.34.</note> throne is the heaven of heavens, and the<note n="b" place="margin">Habak. 3.15.</note> ſea his floare to walke in, the<note n="c" place="margin">Eſai. 66.1.</note> earth his footſtoole to tread vpon, who hath a chaire in the conſcience, and ſits in the<note n="d" place="margin">Pſal. 7.9.</note> heart of man, &amp; poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſeth his ſecret reines, and divides betwixt the fleſh and the skinne, and ſhaketh his inmoſt powers, as the<note n="e" place="margin">Pſal. 29.8.</note> thu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der ſhaketh the wilderneſſe of <hi>Cades.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This powerfull and great IEHOVAH, God almightie, ſpake in <hi>old</hi> time to our <hi>fathers</hi> by the mouth of <hi>Moſes.</hi> Exod. 4.12. and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:1729:13"/> in the <hi>mouthes</hi> of all his <hi>Prophets</hi> Hebr. 1.1. <hi>Know this,</hi> ſaith <hi>S. Peter</hi> in his ſecond epiſtle 1. chap. ver. 20. That <hi>no Prophecie in the Scripture is of any private motion.</hi> Marke his reaſon verſ. 21. <hi>for the Prophecie came not in old time by the will of man, but holie men of God spake as they were moved by the holy Ghoſt.</hi> Hence ſprang theſe vſuall and familiar ſpeeches in the bookes of the Prophets: <hi>The word of the</hi> LORD <hi>came vnto me: The</hi> LORD <hi>God hath spoken: Thus ſaith the</hi> LORD; and the like.</p>
            <p>This LORD, who thus ſpake in <hi>old</hi> time by his <hi>Prophets,</hi> did in fulnes of time, when he ſent his Sonne to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſummate, &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the work of mans rede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ption, ſpeak by his bleſſed Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, &amp; Apoſtles. This appeareth by the faithfull promiſe made them, Mat. 10.19. <hi>Take no thought how, or what yee ſhall speake, for it ſhall be given you what yee ſhall ſay. It is not yee that ſpeake, but the spirit of your Father that ſpeaketh in you.</hi> It muſt ſtand for truth in diſpite of al the powers of darkenes, which is recorded 2. Tim. 3.16. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; <hi>The whole Scripture,</hi> &amp; eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry parcell therof, <hi>is given by inspiration of</hi> GOD, and hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward witneſſe from that Spirit, which is the author of all truth.</p>
            <p>Hence ariſeth this true poſition: <hi>Scriptura est authentica re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gula tum fidei, tum vitae noſtrae: The word of God,</hi> which by an excellencie we call the <hi>Scripture,</hi> is <hi>an infallible rule both of our faith, and alſo of our life.</hi> And another poſition followeth here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon: <hi>The authoritie of holy Scripture is greater, then the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our obſervation here may be: Since ſuch is the worth of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture by reaſon of the author of it, as that <hi>it is the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect rule for our faith, and life;</hi> and is <hi>of greater authoritie then the Church,</hi> it muſt be our part to take heed vnto it, to heare it, and to read it with reverence, obſequie, and docilitie.</p>
            <p>This worth, dignitie, and excellencie of holy Scripture, which is Gods holy word, now commended vnto you, yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth a very harſh and vnpleaſant ſound to every Popiſhly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected eare, and may ſerue to condemne the <hi>Romiſh Church</hi> of impiety, and ſinne for her neglect, and contempt of ſo ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable a treaſure.

            <p>All three are further made good in the infallible evidence of the written word of God.</p>
            <p>The firſt was:<note n="ſ" place="margin">Regna à Deo &amp; Reges dari. Lipſius, Monit Polit. lib. 1. c. 5. p. 24</note> 
               <hi>Kings, and Kingdomes, are given by God.</hi> Thus ſaith the LORD of <hi>Saules</hi> ſucceſſour, 1. Sam. 16.1. <hi>I haue provided me a King among</hi> the <hi>ſonnes</hi> of <hi>Iſchai:</hi> and of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt of the ten tribes, in the rent of the kingdome of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> 1. King. 12.24. <hi>This thing is done by me:</hi> &amp; of the victories which <hi>Nabuchodonoſor</hi> was to get over the King of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and other his neighbour Kings; the Kings of <hi>Edom,</hi> of <hi>Moab,</hi> of the <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monites,</hi> of <hi>Tyre,</hi> of <hi>Zidon,</hi> Ier. 27.6. <hi>I haue given all theſe lands into the hand of Nabuchodonoſor the King of Babel, my ſervant.</hi> It is true which we learne, Pſal. 75.6. <hi>Advancement is neither from the Eaſt, nor from the Weſt, nor from the wilderneſſe.</hi> Our <hi>God is iudge;</hi> he <hi>alone advanceth.</hi> You ſee now, it is plaine by holy Scripture, that <hi>Kings, and Kingdomes, are given by God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond was:<note n="t" place="margin">Regna à Deo &amp; Reges tolli Lipſ. ib. pag. 28.</note> 
               <hi>Kings, and Kingdomes are taken away by God.</hi> That Gods hand is likewiſe exerciſed in the removall of Kings, &amp; tranſlation of kingdomes, its wel known, as by the aboue-cited texts of Scripture, ſo by divine examples, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

            </p>
            <p>The third was,<note n="r" place="margin">Regna à Deo &amp; Reges temperari. Lipſ. Ibid. p. 34.</note> 
               <hi>Kings, and Kingdomes, are ordered, ruled, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by God.</hi> For proofe hereof I need no more, but remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber you, of that which I reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended to you in the beginning of this Sermon, even of the wonderfull extent of Gods care &amp; providence to the leaſt and baſeſt things in this world: as I ſaid to a handfull of meale; to a cruſe of oile in a poore wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes houſe; to the falling of ſparrowes to the ground; to the feeding of the birds of the aire; to the calving of hinds; to the clothing of the graſſe of the field; to the numbring of the haires of our heads; to the trickling of tears down our cheeks. Shall God care for theſe vile and baſe things? and ſhall he not much more order, rule, and governe Kings, and kingdomes?</p>
            <p>Now (beloved in the Lord) you ſee by the evidence of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture that Kings, and Kingdomes are wholy and alone in the diſpoſition of the Almightie. Giue eare I beſeech you, while I ſhew you how this doctrine, and the holy word of God, whereon it is grounded, is in popiſh religion neglected, diſgraced, troden vnder foot.</p>

            </p>
            <p>This is that obvious, and much vſed diſtinction in ſchoole divinity: <hi>Inchoativè,</hi> &amp; <hi>terminative.</hi> I thus expound it. In theſe now named workes of God, the <hi>voice</hi> that was ſpoken vnto CHRIST; the <hi>Doue</hi> that deſcended vpon CHRIST, the <hi>body</hi> and <hi>ſoule</hi> of CHRIST, We are to conſider two things: their <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,</hi> and their <hi>end.</hi> If we reſpect their <hi>beginning,</hi> they are the workes of the whole <hi>Trinity,</hi> common vnto all; but reſpect we their <hi>perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi> and <hi>end,</hi> they are no more common, but <hi>hypoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall</hi> &amp; <hi>perſonall,</hi> for ſo the <hi>voice</hi> is the <hi>Fathers</hi> alone; the <hi>Doue</hi> is the <hi>Holy Ghoſts</hi> alone; the reaſonable <hi>ſoule,</hi> and humane <hi>fleſh</hi> are the <hi>Sonnes</hi> alone.</p>
            <p>Beſides theſe, there are other workes of God, as begunne ſo ended alſo <hi>EXTRA PERSONAS; externally:</hi> and they are of two ſorts: either <hi>ſupernatural,</hi> (ſuch I cal the miraculous works of God;) or <hi>naturall;</hi> ſuch as are the creation of the world, the preſervation of the ſame, and the government of it. All theſe workes of which kinde ſoever, whether miraculous, or works of nature, are common to the whole TRINITIE. The <hi>Father</hi> worketh, the <hi>Sonne</hi> worketh, and the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> worketh, as in doing of wonders; ſo in creating all things, in preſerving all things, in governing all things. Wherevpon followeth that which before I affirmed; that as the <hi>Father</hi> is LORD, ſo the <hi>Son</hi>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:1729:19"/> is LORD, and the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> is LORD alſo. So the LORD, whom I commended vnto you for the ſpeaker in my text, is the <hi>Vnitie</hi> in <hi>Trinitie,</hi> one God in three perſons, God Almightie, the <hi>Father, Sonne,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before I go on, to ſhew you, how he ſpeaketh, I muſt make bold vpon your patience, to tell you of ſome duties, <hi>neceſſarie duties,</hi> to be performed by vs towards him, as LORD. God is the LORD, we are his ſervants. The duties we owe him in this reſpect are three: to <hi>obey</hi> him, to <hi>ſerue</hi> him, to <hi>profit</hi> him.</p>
            <p>The firſt duty required of vs, is <hi>obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce</hi> vnto God his word, lawes, &amp; commandements. This duty whoſoever performeth, ſhall eaſilie performe the ſecond duty, to wit, faithfull <hi>ſervice,</hi> with all care and diligence to do whatſoever worke it pleaſeth God to employ him in: and ſhall not leaue vndone the thirde dutie, but ſhall doe <hi>good,</hi> and be <hi>profitable</hi> vnto the LORD.</p>
            <p>All theſe duties were well diſcharged by our firſt parent <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam.</hi> As long as he was inveſted with his roabe of innocencie, he was perfectly <hi>obedient,</hi> a faithfull <hi>ſervant,</hi> and <hi>profitable</hi> to his LORD.</p>
            <p>Now if it wil be doubted here how a man ſhould be <hi>profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> to God; thus I anſwere. That Gods <hi>riches</hi> doe conſiſt in his <hi>glory,</hi> and therefore if his <hi>glory</hi> be increaſed and enlarged, his <hi>advantage</hi> is procured. The parable of the talents, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.14. confirmeth this point. The parable is there plainely delivered vnto you. The meaning of it is; that God giveth vs his graces to this end, that we ſhould <hi>vſe</hi> and increaſe them for his adva<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. Yea God there compareth himſelfe to a covetous <hi>vſurer,</hi> ſo greedy of <hi>gaine,</hi> as that he <hi>reapeth,</hi> where he <hi>ſowed</hi> not, and <hi>gathereth</hi> where he <hi>ſcatered</hi> not. By all meanes he laboureth to gaine <hi>glory</hi> to himſelfe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eliphaz</hi> in the 22. chapt. of <hi>Iob</hi> ver. 2.3. ſeemeth in worde to thwart, and croſſe this doctrine. For ſaith he; may a man be <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable</hi> vnto <hi>God? Is it any thing to the Almighty, that thou art righteous? Or is it profitable to him, that thou makeſt thy waies vp right?</hi> I anſwere, that <hi>God</hi> indeed is not ſo tied to <hi>man,</hi> but that he can ſet forth his <hi>glory,</hi> without him, or his righteouſnes; yea
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:1729:20"/> he can glorifie himſelfe in the vnrighteouſnes, and deſtruction of man: yet I ſay, that to ſtirre vp m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

You ſhall find it without any mention of the Lords voice, Hoſ. 11.10. <hi>The</hi> LORD <hi>ſhall roare like a Lion: when hee ſhall roare, then the children of the weſt ſhall feare.</hi> You ſhall find it with applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Amos 3.8. <hi>The Lyon hath roared; who will not be afraid?

            <p n="2">2 <hi>In deed only:</hi> as when no <hi>voice</hi> is heard, but ſome ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance only is objected to the ſenſes. <hi>S.

               <hi>The dwelling places of the ſhepheards]</hi> In my firſt lecture vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this prophecy, I told you there were two ſorts of <hi>ſhepheards.</hi> In the firſt rancke, I placed <hi>ſheepmaſters;</hi> in the ſecond, their <hi>ſervants.</hi> Among the firſt ſort of ſhepheards was <hi>Meſa King</hi> of <hi>Moab:</hi> who 2. <hi>King</hi> 3.4. is called a <hi>ſhepheard,</hi> and there regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred

Our <hi>Engliſh reading</hi> then for the ſenſe is good, <hi>The dwelling places of the ſhepheards ſhall periſh.</hi>
            </p>

            <q>Sinne and iniquitie are meanes to lay waſt, and make deſolate [our dwelling houſes] yea the faireſt, and goodlieſt buildings; all manner of buildings.</q>

            <p>A ſecond note for your further inſtruction, and meditation followeth. It is true? <hi>Are ſinne and iniquitie means to lay waſt, &amp; make deſolate all manner of buildings?</hi> How then is it, that <hi>our dwelling houſes</hi> doe yet ſtand, and flouriſh? Our <hi>ſinnes,</hi> and <hi>ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities,</hi>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:1729:31"/> are exceeding impudent, and ſawcie; they are aſcended into the preſence of God, and doe ſtand like <hi>Sathan</hi> among his children before his face. Yet for all this impudencie, and ſaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cineſſe of our <hi>ſinnes</hi> and <hi>iniquities,</hi> God is pleaſed to ſuffer <hi>our dwelling houſes</hi> to be in ſafetie. The conſideration of this point may ſtirre vs vp to a gratefull agnition, and acknowledgment of Gods ſingular bountie, and longanimitie. It is out of the bountie of the LORD, that the earth, ſince the time it firſt was curſed for the fall of man, doth to this day yeeld fruit in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance for the vſe of man. That our poſſeſſions, habitations, dwelling houſes, and Churches are not laid waſt, and made de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate, it is to be aſcribed to Gods long ſufferance, and longa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimitie. Of which I ſhall (God willing) anon ſpeake more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I ſhal haue conſidered the words of the ſecond ſequel, or conſequent of Gods ſpeech, which are: <hi>The top of Carmel ſhall wither.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The top of Carmel]</hi> There were two hills of this name, as <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Hierome</hi> teacheth; both in <hi>Iudea;</hi> the one in the ſoutherne cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of that country, whereon <hi>Nabal</hi> the husband of <hi>Abigail</hi> did dwel, 1. Sam. 25.2. the other neere vnto <hi>Ptolemais,</hi> towards the ſea coaſt, vpon which <hi>Elias</hi> prayed for raine, 1. Kings 18.42. <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Hierome</hi> ſeemeth to doubt, which of theſe two <hi>Carmels</hi> our Prophet here intendeth. But <hi>Ribera</hi> reſolveth for that <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel,</hi> which was neere vnto <hi>Ptolemais,</hi> becauſe it did appertaine to the lot of the ten tribes, againſt whom <hi>Amos</hi> in this booke prophecieth.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Carmel</hi> was a hill of much fatneſſe, and fertilitie: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon it may, as proverbially, be taken for any ſuch place. S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erome</hi> writing vpon Eſay 16. ſaith, it is the Scriptures idiome, and proper forme of ſpeech evermore to compare the rich hil, <hi>Carmel,</hi> to fertilitie, and abundance. One of the Hebrewe<note n="d" place="margin">R. David apud Druſiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> Doctors ſaith, that <hi>Carmel</hi> is a generall name for all fruitfull arable fields, and vineyards. A great<note n="e" place="margin">Pagnin.</note> Hebrician ſaith, that becauſe the hill, <hi>Carmel,</hi> had by it a valley of exceeding fera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie, and fruitfulneſſe, therefore <hi>Carmel</hi> is appellatiuely taken for any place ſet with corne, trees, or vines; and ſpecially with
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:1729:31"/> ſtanding corne, with newe and fat wheat while it is in eare: though another<note n="f" place="margin">Marinus in Arca Noe</note> 
               <hi>Hebrician</hi> of like note, affirmeth that becauſe <hi>Carmel</hi> collectiuely ſignifieth ſtanding corne, or new wheate yet in the eare, therefore a certaine region in the province of <hi>Canaan</hi> of extraordinary fertilitie (as alſo a hill, and city there) was called after this name, <hi>Carmel.</hi> Whatſoever <hi>Carmel</hi> bee in this place, whether a proper name, or an appellatiue, out of doubt it betokeneth a place of much fruitfulneſſe. Following the ſtreame of expoſitors, I am of opinion, that <hi>Carmel</hi> in my text, is that ſame fruitfull mountaine of <hi>Iudea</hi> by <hi>Ptolemais.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The top of Carmel]</hi> A place fit by reaſon of the woodes there, to lurke, and lie hid in; as is plaine by <hi>Amos,</hi> 9.3. <hi>Though they hide themſelues in the top of</hi> Carmel, <hi>I will ſearch, and take them out thence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The top of Carmel]</hi> In the Hebrew it is the <hi>head of Carmel.</hi> The <hi>head,</hi> or <hi>top</hi> of <hi>Carmel,</hi> is the Scripture phraſe, to expreſſe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is beſt in <hi>Carmel.</hi> By the like phraſe we ſay <hi>Caput vngue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti,</hi> the <hi>head</hi> or the <hi>top of the ointment,</hi> to ſignifie the <hi>beſt</hi> of the ointment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The top of Carmel] Pagnine</hi> thus tranſlateth it, <hi>vertex loci fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilis:</hi> the top of the fruitfull place. And <hi>Iunius</hi> thus: <hi>praeſtantiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum aruorum:</hi> the beſt of the fields. Both <hi>Pagnine,</hi> and <hi>Iunius,</hi> doe take <hi>Carmel</hi> here for an appellatiue, and not for a proper name.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The top of Carmel ſhall wither]</hi> ſhall wax dry, or be dried vp. That is, where moſt fruitfull fields, and paſtures are, there ſhall be a defect, and want of neceſſaries for mans life.</p>
            <p>Thus haue you the expoſition of this laſt clauſe. Nowe bee patient, I pray you, while from hence I commend on leſſon vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you. It is this:
<q>For the ſinnes of a people, God will make the top of their Carmel to wither.</q> I ſpeake it more plainely.</p>
            <q>For the ſinnes of a people, God will make their beſt groundes to yeeld them little, or no profit.</q>
            <p>For proofe of this point, you will be pleaſed to heare the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:1729:32"/> of the holy Spirit, given in the word of life, Deut. 28.20, Thus ſaith the LORD: <hi>becauſe of the wickednes of thy works, whereby thou haſt forſaken mee, the</hi> LORD <hi>ſhall ſmite thee with blaſting, and with mildew: the Heaven which is over thy head ſhal be braſſe, and the earth that is vnder thee, ſhall be yron: inſteed of raine, the</hi> LORD <hi>ſhall giue thee duſt and aſhes, even from heaven ſhall it come downe vpon thee vntill thou be deſtroyed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the 2. Chapter of Hoſea, and the 5 verſe, becauſe <hi>Iſrael,</hi> had plaid the harlot, and done ſhamefully, departing from the LORD, thus ſaith the LORD: <hi>I will take away from Iſrael my corne in the time thereof, and my wine in the ſeaſon thereof, &amp; wil recover my wooll, &amp; my flax, which I lent her, to cover her ſhame.</hi> Marke I beſeech you, the manner of the LORDS ſpeech, <hi>my corne, my wine, my woll, my flax;</hi> they are none of ours, they are all the Lords. The LORD hath lent the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs, to ſerue our turnes, and neceſſities: if we abuſe them to idolatrie, or prophanes, he will take them from vs, &amp; recover them againe vnto himſelfe.</p>
            <p>In the 4. Chapter of Hoſea, and the 3. verſe, becauſe there is no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land: but every one breaketh out by <hi>ſwearing,</hi> by <hi>lying,</hi> by <hi>killing,</hi> by <hi>ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> by <hi>whoring,</hi> and blood toucheth blood, thus ſaith the LORD: <hi>the land ſhall mourne, and every one that dwelleth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſhall be cut of, with the beaſts of the field, and with the foules of heaven, and alſo the fiſhes of the ſea ſhal be taken away.</hi> If ſo: what good then comes to you from <hi>Carmel,</hi> from your beſt, &amp; moſt fruitfull grounds?</p>
            <p>In the 8. chapter of <hi>Hoſea,</hi> and the 7. verſe, becauſe <hi>Iſrael</hi> tranſgreſſing the covenant of the LORD, and treſpaſſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his law, <hi>had ſowen the winde,</hi> thus ſaith the LORD: <hi>they ſhall reape the whirlewinde: it hath no stalke;</hi> the <hi>bud ſhall bring forth no meal; if ſo be, it bring forth, the ſtrangers ſhall devoure it.</hi> If ſo; what profit then can we, matching <hi>Iſrael</hi> in their moſt grievous tranſgreſſions, &amp; treſpaſſes, expect from <hi>Carmel,</hi> our moſt fruitfull, and pleaſant fields.</p>
            <p>The wiſeſt <hi>King</hi> that ever ſacred writ made mention of, hath this ſaying, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13.25. <hi>The belly of the wicked ſhall want.</hi> True
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:1729:32"/> great <hi>Solomon.</hi> The belly of the wicked man ſhall be emptie. His <hi>Carmel,</hi> the very beſt of his poſſeſſions, ſhall yeeld him lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle profit.</p>
            <p>To make an end of this diſcourſe, I would, I could write it in your harts, what the ſweeteſt ſinger, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 107.34. delivereth vnto you, touching this point: it is worthy your beſt remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance. <hi>A fruitfull land God turneth into barrennes, for the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that dwell therein.</hi> This one place (had I troubled you with no more) would haue been a pregnant, and ſufficient proofe of my propounded doctrine. What <hi>fruit</hi> can you look for out of <hi>barrenneſſe?</hi> And by this one place you ſee, that God turneth a <hi>fruitfull</hi> land into <hi>barrenneſſe,</hi> for the <hi>wickedneſſe</hi> of them, that dwell therein. You muſt then acknowledge the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon commended vnto you to be good, and true; namely, that <hi>for the ſinnes of a people, God will make their</hi> Carmel <hi>to wither;</hi> that for the ſinnes of a people, God will make beſt grounds to yeeld them little, or no profit.</p>
            <p>Now let vs ſee, what vſe we may make of this doctrine for our further inſtructions.</p>
            <p>A firſt vſe, is to admoniſh ſuch as doe dwell in delectable, pleaſant, well watred, and fruitfull places, that they boaſt not overmuch of their fertile, and ſweet poſſeſſions: ſince there is no land ſo <hi>delectable</hi> to the eie, or <hi>fruitfull</hi> to the purſe, but it may be turned into a <hi>wilderneſſe.</hi> If for our ſinnes God ſhall come againſt vs in the fierceneſſe of his wrath; we ſhall be as<note n="g" place="margin">Eſay, 1.9.</note> 
               <hi>Sodom,</hi> and like vnto <hi>Gomorah:</hi> our land ſhall burne with <hi>brimſtone,</hi> and<note n="h" place="margin">Deut. 29.23</note> ſalt; it ſhall not be ſowen, nor ſhall bring forth; neither ſhall any graſſe grow therein. O LORD, deale not with vs after our ſinnes, neither reward vs according to our iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
            <p>A ſecond vſe, is to warne rich men, the richer ſort among you, that weighing rightly the power of Almighty God, by which he maketh the top of <hi>Carmel</hi> to wither, &amp; turneth your <hi>fruitfull</hi> fields into <hi>barrenneſſe;</hi> you will beware of inſolencie, and containe your ſelues in modeſtie, and ſubmiſſion. Know this; there is no man hath a foote of ground, or never ſo ſmall a
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:1729:33"/> poſſeſſion to dwel in, but he hath it at Gods hand; and vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this condition; that he keepe his ſtatutes, and commaundements. Which if you diſobey, contemne, and caſt behinde you, aſſure your ſelues, your riches are none of yours, you are not the right owners of them; but meere vſurpers. The LORD of hoaſts wil ſend an hoaſt of enimies againſt you.</p>
            <p>Art thou rich in <hi>mony?</hi> thou art in danger of <hi>theeues:</hi> art thou plentifull in <hi>houſhold ſtuffe?</hi> thou art in danger of <hi>fire:</hi> haſt thou much <hi>gold?</hi> the <hi>ruſt</hi> doth venime it, and thee: is thine <hi>apparell</hi> gorgious? the <hi>moth</hi> will eate it: haſt thou ſtore of <hi>cattell? rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenneſſe</hi> may conſume them: is thy maintenance by <hi>husbandrie? blaſting</hi> and <hi>mildewes</hi> will hinder thee, the<note n="i" place="margin">Ioel. 1.4.</note> 
               <hi>palmer worme</hi> will eate thy fruits, that which the <hi>palmer worme</hi> ſhall leaue, the <hi>graſhopper</hi> ſhall eate; that which the <hi>graſhopper</hi> ſhall leaue, the <hi>ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ker worme</hi> ſhal eat; &amp; that which the <hi>ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ker worme</hi> ſhal leaue, the <hi>caterpiller</hi> ſhall eate. So many, and many more enemies can the LORD of hoaſts ſend to fight againſt you; if you hate to be reformed, and caſt his commandements behinde you.</p>
            <p>A third, and the laſt vſe of my propounded doctrine, is, to ſtirre vp my ſelfe, and all you, that heare me this day, grateful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and thankfully to recount the mercifulneſſe, patience, and long ſufferance of our God. Our ſinnes haue deſerved it at his hands, that hee ſhould make the top of our <hi>Carmel</hi> to wither; that he ſhould make our <hi>beſt grounds</hi> to yeeld vs <hi>little,</hi> or <hi>no pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fit;</hi> that he ſhould ſmite vs with <hi>blaſting,</hi> and <hi>mildew;</hi> that hee ſhould make the <hi>Heaven</hi> over our head, <hi>braſſe;</hi> and the <hi>Earth</hi> vnder vs, <hi>yron:</hi> that inſteed of <hi>raine,</hi> hee ſhould giue vs <hi>duſt</hi> and <hi>aſhes;</hi> that he ſhould take from vs, <hi>his</hi> corne, <hi>his</hi> wine, <hi>his</hi> wool, <hi>his</hi> flax, and whatſoever good thing elſe, hee hath lent vs for our vſe. All this, and much more haue our ſinnes deſerved: and yet God withholdeth from vs his revenging hand. O the depth of the riches of the mercifulneſſe, patience, and long ſufferance of our God.</p>
            <p>Yet ſtay yee ſonnes of <hi>Belial,</hi> and imps of Hell; yee wicked ones, who ſerue vnder <hi>Sathans Banner.</hi> Gods mercifulneſſe, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and long ſufferance, is to you very ſmal advantage.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thus ſaith the</hi> LORD] This powerfull IEHOVAH, whoſe throne is the heaven of heavens, and the ſea his floare to walke in, &amp; the earth his footſtoole to tread vpon, who hath a chaire in the conſcience, and fitteth in the heart of man, &amp; poſſeſſeth his ſecreteſt reines, and devideth betwixt the fleſh &amp; the skin, and ſhaketh his inmoſt powers, as the thu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der ſhaketh the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes of <hi>Cades.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thus ſaith the</hi> LORD.] Hath the LORD ſaid, and ſhall he not do it? hath he ſpoken, &amp; ſhal he not accompliſh it? <hi>Balaa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth as much vnto <hi>Balak,</hi> Num. 23.19. <hi>God is not as man, that he ſhould lie, nor as the ſonne of man, that he ſhould repent.</hi> Indeed ſaith <hi>Samuel</hi> (1.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thus ſaith the</hi> LORD.] Then out of doubt it muſt come to paſſe. Hereby you may be perſwaded of the authority of this Prophecie: and not of this only, but of al other the Prophecies of holy Scripture; that neither this, nor any other Prophecie of old, is deſtitute of divine authority. This point touching the authority of holy Scripture I delivered vnto you in my ſecond lecture, and therefore haue now the leſſe need to ſpend time therein. Yet a word or two thereof.</p>
            <p>God almighty ſpake in old time to our <hi>fathers by the mouth of Moſes,</hi> Exod. 4.12. &amp; not by the mouth of <hi>Moſes</hi> only, but by <hi>the mouths of all his Prophets,</hi> Heb. 1.1. &amp; 2. Peter 1.20. <hi>Know this that no Prophecy in the Scripture is of any private motion.</hi> He giveth the reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hereof ver. 21. <hi>for the Prophecy in old time came not by the will of man, but holy men of God ſpake, as they were mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the holy Ghoſt.</hi> Hence ſprang thoſe vſuall and familiar ſpeeches in the bookes of the Prophets; The <hi>The word of the</hi>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:1729:36"/> LORD <hi>came vnto me;</hi> the LORD <hi>God hath spoken;</hi> and this in my text, <hi>Thus ſaith the</hi> LORD. This LORD, who thus ſpake in old time by his <hi>Prophets,</hi> did in fulneſſe of time, when hee ſent to conſummate, and perfect the worke of mans redemption, ſpeake by his bleſſed <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This appeareth by the faithfull promiſe made vnto them, Matth. 10.19. <hi>Take no thought how, or what yee, ſhall ſpeake; for it ſhall be given you, what yee ſhall ſay. It is not yee that ſpeake, but the Spirit of your father, that ſpeaketh in you.</hi> It muſt ſtand ever true, what is recorded, 2. Tim. 3.16. the <hi>whole Scripture</hi> (and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very parcell thereof) <hi>is given by inſpiration of God:</hi> and hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward witneſſe from that <hi>Spirit,</hi> which is the author of all truth.</p>
            <p>Here may you note the harmonie, conſent, and agreement, of all the Prophets, Evangeliſts, and Apoſtles, from the firſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the laſt: not one of them ſpake one word of a naturall man in all their miniſteries; the wordes, which they ſpake, were the words of him that ſent them: they ſpake not of themſelues, God ſpake in them. Whenſoever were the <hi>time,</hi> whatſoever were the <hi>meanes,</hi> whoſoever were the <hi>man;</hi> wherſoever were the place, whatſoever were the <hi>people,</hi> the words were the <hi>Lords.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thus ſaith the</hi> LORD] Howe then dare wee, <hi>potters clay,</hi> lift vp our hands againſt him, that faſhioned vs? How dare we abſent our ſelues from his houſe of prayer, where God in and by his holy word ſpeaketh vnto vs? How dare we, when we are come to this place, behaue our ſelues careleſly, negligently, irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently?</p>
            <p>But I will not at this time preſſe you any further with this point, having heretofore in my fourth lecture occaſioned by the Lords <hi>roaring out of Sion,</hi> and <hi>vttering his voice from Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> exhorted you in many words, to the due performance of your dutifull ſervice of God in this place. For this preſent, I will onely giue you a taſt of the ſweetneſſe of the worde of the LORD, conveied vnto vs by the miniſteries of his ſanctified Prophets, Evangeliſts, &amp; Apoſtles. It is the <hi>Lords</hi> moſt roial and celeſtiall teſtament, the oracles of his heavenly ſanctuarie,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:1729:37"/> the only key vnto vs of his reveiled counſels; milke from his ſacred breaſtes; the earneſt and pledge of his favour to his Church; the light of our feet, ioy of our hearts, breath of our noſtrils, pillar of our faith, anchor of our hope ground of our loue, evidences, and deeds of our future bleſſedneſſe.</p>
            <p>Thus farre of the preface, proeme, or enterance, making for the authoritie of this prophecie; <hi>Thus ſaith the</hi> LORD.</p>
            <p>Now followeth the prophecie againſt the <hi>Syrians:</hi> wherin I commended to your Chriſtian conſiderations foure things.</p>

               <hi>I will not turne to it]</hi> to them; to the inhabitants of <hi>Damaſcus;</hi> to the <hi>Syrians:</hi> that is, I will haue no mercy on them. Theſe words are diverſly rendred by expoſitors: by the author of the vulgar Latine, and by <hi>Gualter, Non convertam eum.</hi> I will not turne it: that is, I will not recall the <hi>Syrians</hi> of <hi>Damaſcus</hi> to the right way, they ſhal runne on to their owne perdition.

Then may God iuſtly ſay to vs, as hee ſaid vnto the Iewes, Eſai. 65.12. <hi>I called, and ye did not anſwere; I spake and yee heard not.</hi> And albeit ſome fal ſeaven times a day, &amp; riſe againe; albeit to ſome ſinners it pleaſeth the Lord to iterate his ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, yet may not we take encouragement thereby, to iterate our miſdoings. Wee know that God puniſhed his Angels in heaven for <hi>one</hi> breach; <hi>Adam</hi> for <hi>one</hi> morſell; <hi>Miriam</hi> for <hi>one</hi> ſclander; <hi>Moſes</hi> for <hi>one</hi> angry word; <hi>Achan</hi> for <hi>one</hi> ſacrilege; <hi>Ezechias</hi> for <hi>once</hi> ſhewing his treaſures to the Embaſſadours of <hi>Babel; Ioſias</hi> for <hi>once</hi> going to warre without asking coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of the LORD; and <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira</hi> for <hi>once</hi> lying to the holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>Is the Lords hand now ſhortned that he cannot be as ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and quicke, in avenging himſelfe vpon vs for our offences? Farre be it from vs ſo to thinke. God is not ſlacke in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, as ſome count ſlacknes: He maketh the clowds his Chariots, he rideth vpon the Cherubins, he flieth with the wings of the winde; and ſo he commeth; and commeth quickly, and his reward is with him to giue to every one, according as his workes ſhall be.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Babylonians</hi> were wonderfull cruell, and hard hearted
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:1729:42"/> againſt the inhabitants of <hi>Ieruſalem:</hi> they ſpared none of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, no not their young children, but cruelly deſtroyed them, and all theirs. But what was their reward? You may ſee it by the propheticall denuntiation of the ruine of <hi>Babel,</hi> Pſal. 13 7, 8, 9. <hi>O daughter of Babel, worthy to be deſtroyed: bleſſed ſhall he be that rewardeth thee as thou haſt ſerved vs; bleſſed ſhal he be that taketh and daſheth thy children againſt the ſtones.</hi> This reward of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel</hi> is enlarged Eſay. 13.16. <hi>Their children ſhall be broken in pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces before their eies: their houſes ſhall be spoiled; and their wiues raviſhed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus not to trouble you with many examples, we ſee by the reward of <hi>crueltie</hi> in the examples of <hi>Adonibezek, Agag,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> that God abhorreth it.

            <p>The vſe of the doctrine now confirmed, is to work in vs the loue of clemency, and mercifulneſſe.

            <p>Many more are the examples regiſtred in the booke of God, fit to proue this point: which alſo may further appeare vnto you, in thoſe bloody perſecutions after Chriſt his death by the Romane Emperours, in thoſe ſtrange torments which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed to keepe downe religion, and religious profeſſours, men &amp; women; they plucked of their skins quicke; they boared out their eies with wimbles; they broyled the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aliue on gredirons; they ſcalded them in boiling liquors; they encloſed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, and driving great nailes through, tumbled them downe mountaines, till their owne bloud ſo cruelly drawne out, ſtif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled, &amp; choaked them in the barrels: womens breaſts were ſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of with burning yrons, their bodies rent, and their iointes racked.

            </p>
            <p>The reaſon why God <hi>humbleth his ſervants,</hi> vnder his, and their enemies, is their diſobedience to his word. This is plaine, Deut. 28.36, 37. <hi>If thou wilt not obey the voice of the</hi> LORD <hi>thy God, to keepe, and to do all his commandements, &amp; his ordinances, the</hi> LORD <hi>ſhall bring thee, and thy king vnto a nation, which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou, nor thy fathers haue knowne; and there ſhalt thou ſerue other Gods, wood, &amp; ſtone: And thou ſhalt be a wonder, a proverb, and a common talke among all the people, whether the</hi> LORD <hi>ſhall carry thee.</hi> Where you ſee captivity, and baniſhment, denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to Gods owne people, if they diſobey his word.</p>

<q>God often humbleth his ſervants vnder his foes, and their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries.</q>

So farre is the ſignification of <hi>fire,</hi> though not in the naturall, yet in the metaphoricall vnderſtanding extended. The doctrine which from hence I gather is.</p>
            <q>As is the fire, ſo are all other creatures at the Lords comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement to bee imployed by him in the puniſhment of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.</q>
            <p>This truth well appeareth by that which I even now repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of Eccleſ. 39. whence you heard, that <hi>ſome ſpirits are created for vengeance; as alſo are fire, and haile, and famine, and death, and the teeth of wild beaſts, and the ſcorpions, and the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, and the ſword; yea, that the principall things for the whole vſe of mans life, as water, and fire, and yron, and ſalt, and meale, &amp; wheate, and hony, and milke, and the bloud of the grape, and oile, &amp; cloathing, are all for evill vnto the wicked.</hi> If that proofe, becauſe the booke, whence it is taken, is <hi>Apocryphall,</hi> like you not: giue eare I pray you, while I proue it out of <hi>Canonicall</hi> Scripture. The doctrine to be proued is.</p>
            <q>Fire, and all other creatures, are at the Lords commandement to be imploied by him in the puniſhment of the wicked.</q>
            <p>I proue it by the ſervice of Angels, and other creatures. 2. King. 19.35. we read of <hi>an hundred foureſcore and fiue thouſand in the camp of</hi> Aſhur <hi>ſlaine by an Angell of the</hi> LORD. The thing is related alſo, Eſay 37.36.

<q>As is the fire, ſo are all other creatures at the Lords comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement to be employed by him in the puniſhement of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The vſe of this doctrine, is to teach vs: how to behaue our ſelues, at ſuch times, as God ſhall viſit vs with his rodd of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, how to carry our ſelues in all our afflictions. We muſt not ſo much looke to the <hi>inſtruments,</hi> as to the <hi>Lord</hi> that ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth by them.</p>
            <p>Here ſet we before our eyes holy <hi>King Dauid.</hi> His patience! be it the patterne of our Chriſtian imitation. When <hi>Shimei</hi> a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the familie of the houſe of <hi>Saul,</hi> came out againſt him, caſt ſtones at him, &amp; railed vpon him, calling him to his face <hi>a man of blood,</hi> &amp; a <hi>man of Belial,</hi> a <hi>murtherer,</hi> &amp; <hi>a wicked man,</hi> the good <hi>King</hi> did not, as he was wiſhed to doe: he took not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the <hi>murtherers</hi> life, but had reſpect to the <hi>primus motor,</hi> even Almighty God, the firſt mover of this his afflictie; <hi>Shimei</hi> he knew was but the <hi>inſtrument.</hi> And therefore thus ſayth he to Abiſchai, 2. Sam. 16.10. <hi>He curſeth, becauſe the</hi> LORD <hi>had hidden him curſe Dauid; &amp; who dare then ſay, wherefore haſt thou done ſo? Suffer him to curſe for the Lord hath bidden him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here alſo ſet we before our eies holy <hi>Iob.</hi> His <hi>patience</hi> bee it the patterne of our Chriſtian imitation. The loſſe of all his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and his children, by the <hi>Sabeans, Chaldeans, fire</hi> from heauen, and a great <hi>wind</hi> from beyond the wilderneſſe, could not turne away his eyes from the God of heauen to thoſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond cauſes.

            <p>To theſe inſtances of <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Iob,</hi> adde one more; that of the bleſſed Apoſtles, <hi>Peter, Iohn,</hi> &amp; the reſt, Act. 4.27. Though

               <hi>Herod, Pontius Pilate,</hi> the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and the <hi>people of Iſrael,</hi> had crucified and done to death the <hi>Lord of life,</hi> our LORD and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour <hi>Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> Yet did not the Apoſtles therefore grow in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a rage, and bitter ſpeeches againſt them.

            </p>
            <p>To good purpoſe then is that queſtion propounded by <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos</hi> chap. 3.6. <hi>Shall there be evill in a city, and the Lord hath not done it?</hi> It may ſerue for an anchor to keepe vs, that we bee not carried away with the waues of tribulation, and affliction.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Benhadad</hi> (ſaith <hi>Mercer</hi> vpon this place) was a name pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to the Kings of <hi>Syria;</hi> as was firſt <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and afterward <hi>Ptolemee</hi> to the Kings of Egypt, and <hi>Caeſar</hi> to the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours. From this opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Mercer,</hi> Druſius <hi>in obſervat. ſacr.</hi> 11. 14. varieth, affirming that albeit diverſe Kings of <hi>Syria</hi> were called by this name <hi>Benhadad,</hi> yet doth it not therevpon follow, that <hi>Benhadad</hi> was a common name to all the Kings of <hi>Syria.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In holy Scripture we read of three <hi>Benhadads.</hi> Of the firſt, 1. Kings, 15.18. who was <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Syria,</hi> at what time <hi>Aſa</hi> raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in <hi>Iudah,</hi> and <hi>Baaſha</hi> in <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Of the ſecond, 2. Kings, 8.7. who in his ſickneſſe ſent <hi>Hazael</hi> to <hi>Elizeus,</hi> the man of God, for counſaile. Of the third, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>. Kings, 13.3. who was <hi>Hazaels</hi> ſonne, and his ſucceſſour in the throne.</p>
            <p>Now the <hi>Benhadad</hi> in my text, is either <hi>Benhadad, Hazaels</hi> predeceſſour, ſlaine by <hi>Hazael,</hi> or <hi>Benhadad, Hazaels</hi> ſonne, &amp; ſucceſſour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The palaces of Benhadad,]</hi> to bee devoured by <hi>fire</hi> from the LORD. Theſe palaces of <hi>Benhadad</hi> are the goodly, ſumptuous, proud, and ſtately edifices made, or enlarged, by either of the <hi>Benhadads,</hi> or by both; <hi>Hazaels</hi> predeceſſour, and ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour.</p>
            <p>Thus haue you the expoſition of my third circumſtance, which was concerning the parties puniſhed; no meane parties; parties of no lower rancke then Kings: <hi>Hazael,</hi> and <hi>Benhadad;</hi> The LORD puniſheth, hee puniſheth by <hi>fire;</hi> hee puniſheth by fire <hi>Hazael,</hi> and <hi>Benhadad; I will ſend a fire into the houſe of</hi> Hazael, <hi>and it ſhall devoure the palaces of</hi> Benhadad.

               <hi>I will alſo breake the barres of Damaſcus]</hi> To <hi>breake</hi> in the Hebrew phraſe, &amp; by a <hi>Metaphore,</hi> is to <hi>conſume,</hi> to <hi>deſtroy,</hi> to <hi>waſt,</hi> to <hi>spoile.</hi> In the 24 of Eſ. verſ. 19. where the Prophet ſaith; <hi>confractione confringetur terra:</hi> the earth ſhall with <hi>breaking</hi> be <hi>broken;</hi> the meaning is: the earth ſhall certainely be waſted, and ſpoiled. So here; <hi>I will breake the barre of Damaſcus,</hi> that is, I wil co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſume, and ſpoile, all the munitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, all the fortificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, all

            </p>
            <p>This office of <hi>breaking</hi> barres, God elſewhere aſſumeth to himſelfe, as Eſai. 45.2. where thus ſaith the LORD vnto <hi>Cyrus,</hi> his anoynted; <hi>I will breake the braeſon doores, &amp; barſt the yron barres.</hi> The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> alſo aſcribeth vnto the LORD this office of breaking barres, Pſal. 107.16. where exhorting vs to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe before the LORD his loving kindnes, and to declare his wonderfull workes, he bringeth this for a reaſon: <hi>For he hath broken the gates of braſſe, and hath burſts the barre of yron aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</hi> Now haue you the meaning of theſe wordes: <hi>I will breake the barre of Damaſcus; I]</hi> the LORD, <hi>will breake]</hi> by my migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie power, will lay waſt, and conſume, <hi>the barre]</hi> barre for barres, all the ſtrength, <hi>of Damaſcus]</hi> of that part of <hi>Syria,</hi> which bordereth vpon <hi>Damaſcus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now let vs ſee what leſſons may bee taken from hence for our further inſtruction, &amp; meditation. You will remember my three propounded circumſtances; The <hi>puniſher,</hi> The <hi>puniſheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,</hi> The <hi>puniſhed.</hi> The puniſher, is the LORD; the puniſhment, is breaking of barres; the puniſhed, is the whole countrey of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſcus.</hi> From the firſt circumſtance of the <hi>puniſher,</hi> the LORD himſelfe taking vengeance into his owne hand, I gather this doctrine.</p>

            <p>Theſe few now alleaged inſtances doe ſufficiently (though briefly) confirme my propounded doctrine.</p>
            <q>There is no thing, nor creature, able to withſtand Gods power, or to let his purpoſe.</q>
            <p>The reaſon hereof is: becauſe God only is <hi>omnipotent,</hi> and whatſoever elſe is in the world it is weake, and <hi>vnable to reſiſt.</hi> Of Gods <hi>omnipotencie</hi> we make our daily profeſſion in the firſt article of our beleefe, profeſſing him to be <hi>God, the Father Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie.</hi> In which profeſſion wee doe not exclude, either the <hi>Sonne,</hi> or <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> from <hi>omnipotencie.</hi> For God the Father, who imparteth his Godhead vnto the <hi>Sonne,</hi> and to the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> doth communicate the proprieties of his <hi>Godhead</hi> to them alſo. And therefore our beleefe is, that as the Father is <hi>Almightie,</hi> ſo the Sonne is <hi>Almightie,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> is <hi>Almightie</hi> too.</p>
            <p>Now God is ſaid to be <hi>omnipotent,</hi> or <hi>Almightie,</hi> in two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects. Firſt, becauſe <hi>he is able to doe, whatſoever he will.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe <hi>hee is able to doe more, then he will.</hi> For the firſt; that
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:1729:55"/> 
               <hi>God is able to doe, whatſoever he will,</hi> who but the man poſſeſſed with the ſpirit of Atheiſme, and infidelitie, dares deny? This truth being expreſly delivered twiſe in the booke of Pſalmes; Firſt, Pſal. 115.3. <hi>Our God in heaven, doth whatſoever hee will:</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, Pſal. 135.6. <hi>Whatſoever pleaſeth the</hi> LORD, <hi>that doth he, in heaven, in earth, in the ſea, in all the depthes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the ſecond that <hi>God is able to doe more, then hee will doe:</hi> every Chriſtian, acquainted with the Evangelicall ſtory, doth acknowledge it. It is plaine by <hi>Iohn Baptiſts</hi> reproofe of the Phariſees, and Sadducees, Matth. 3.9. <hi>Thinke not to ſay within your ſelues, we haue</hi> Abraham <hi>to our Father; for I ſay vnto you, that God is able of theſe ſtones to raiſe vp childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto Abraham. Able,</hi> but <hi>will not.</hi> So likewiſe, when <hi>Chriſt</hi> was betrayed, the ſtory, Matth. 26.53. is, that <hi>God the Father could haue give<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him more then twelue legions of Angels, to haue delivered him.</hi> Hee <hi>could,</hi> but <hi>would not.</hi> The like may be ſaid of many other things. The Father was <hi>able</hi> to haue created another world; yea a thouſand worlds. Was <hi>able,</hi> but <hi>would not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You ſee for Gods <hi>omnipotencie,</hi> that he is <hi>able to do, whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he will do;</hi> yea that he is <hi>able to do more, then he will do.</hi> God only is <hi>omnipotent:</hi> whatſoever els is in the world, it's <hi>weake,</hi> &amp; <hi>vnable to reſiſt:</hi> which is the very ſumme of my doctrine already propounded, and confirmed.</p>
            <q>There is no thing, nor creature, able to withſtand Gods power, or to let his purpoſe.</q>
            <p>For as <hi>Iob</hi> ſaith, chap. 9.13. <hi>The moſt mighty helps do ſtoope vnder Gods anger.</hi> This is it, which <hi>Nabuchodonoſor,</hi> Dan. 4.34, 35. co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſeth: <hi>In compariſon of the moſt high, who liveth for ever, whoſe power is an everlaſting power, whoſe kingdome is fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to generatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; all the inhabita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of the earth are reputed as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; according to his will, he worketh in the army of heaven, and in the inhabitants of the earth; and none can ſtay his hand, nor ſay vnto him, what doeſt thou?</hi> This is it, whereat <hi>S. Paul</hi> aimeth in his queſtion demanded, Rom. 9.19. <hi>Who hath reſiſted the will of God?</hi> And this is it, which <hi>Iob</hi> intendeth, chap. 9.4. demanding a like queſtion: <hi>who hath beene fierce againſt God, and hath proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered?</hi>

            <q>There is no thing, nor creature, able to withſtand Gods power, or to let his purpoſe.</q>
            <p>Now let vs conſider ſome duties, wherevnto we are moved by this doctrine of Gods <hi>omnipotencie.</hi>

            <p>Let the conſideration of this our wretched eſtate, worke in vs the fruits of true humiliatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. This true humiliation ſtandeth in our practiſe of three things. 1. <hi>The ſorrow of our heart,</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are diſpleaſed with our ſelues, and aſhamed in reſpect of our ſinnes. 2. <hi>Our confeſſion to God,</hi> in which we muſt alſo doe three things. 1.

            <p>A patterne whereof I preſent vnto you, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.17, 18, 19.

            </p>
            <p>A memorable example, brought home as it were to our doores, to put vs in minde, of Gods heavy wrath againſt thoſe, which <hi>ſcorne</hi> his <hi>iudgements.</hi> Let vs (beloved) be wiſe vpon it, and at every iudgement of God <hi>tremble,</hi> and <hi>feare,</hi> &amp; confeſſe, as before out of Pſal. 76.7. <hi>Thou, O God of Iacob, thou art to bee feared; who ſhall ſtand in thy ſight, when thou art angry?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3 Is there <hi>no thing, nor creature able to withſtand Gods power, or to let his purpoſe?</hi> Here is matter enough to vphold, and ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh our faith in Gods promiſes, to the aboliſhing of all <hi>wave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,</hi> and <hi>doubting</hi> touching our <hi>ſalvation.</hi> Thus: <hi>No thing, nor

            <p>Vpon this rocke of <hi>Gods omnipotency Abrahams</hi> faith ſtood vnſhaken, as appeareth Rom. 4. <hi>Abraham</hi> he <hi>doubted not of the promiſe of God through vnbeliefe,</hi> but was <hi>ſtrengthned in the faith.</hi> And how?

            <p>And why is all this written of <hi>Abraham? S.

            <p>
               <hi>I will cut off]</hi> To <hi>cut off,</hi> is in ſundry places of holy Scripture a <hi>Metaphore,</hi> drawne <hi>ab exciſione arborum;</hi> from the <hi>cutting downe,</hi> or rooting vp of trees: and ſignifieth, vtterly to conſume to waſt, to diſſipate, to deſtroy, to exſtinguiſh. So it's vſed, Pſ. 101.8. where <hi>David,</hi> purpoſing not to be negligent, or ſloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, in the execution of iuſtice againſt all malefactors in <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> reſolueth to <hi>cut of all the workers of iniquitie</hi> from the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the LORD: <hi>Betimes will I deſtroy all the wicked of the land, that I may cut of all the workers of iniquitie from the city of the</hi> LORD. So its vſed, Pſal. 109.15. where <hi>Davids</hi> prayer againſt the wicked is; <hi>that their iniquitie, and ſinne be alwaies before the</hi> LORD, <hi>that he may out off their memorial from the earth.</hi> So it's vſed, Ezech. 14.13. <hi>Sonne of man when a land ſinneth againſt me by committing a treſpaſſe, then will I ſtretch out mine hand vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it, and will breake the ſtaffe of bread thereof; and wil ſend famine vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, and will cut off man and beaſt from it: I will cut off]</hi> that is, I will deſtroy both man and beaſt from a ſinfull land.</p>
            <p>I omit many like places of holy writte; and commend vnto you, but one more, parallell to this in my text. It is in the 3. ver. of the 2. chap. of this prophecie. There thus ſaith the LORD; <hi>I will cut of the iudge out of the midſt of</hi> Moab; as here in my text, <hi>I will cut off the inhabitant of</hi> Bikeath-Aven; and verſe the 8. <hi>I will cut off the inhabitant from</hi> Aſhdod. <hi>I will cut off,</hi> whether <hi>the iudge out of the middeſt of</hi> Moab; or <hi>the inhabitant from</hi> Aſhdod; or <hi>the inhabitant of</hi> Bikeath-Aven, the meaning is one, and the ſame: <hi>I will cut off,</hi> that is, I will vtterly deſtroy, or extinguiſh.</p>
            <p>Which to bee the meaning of the word, the author of the <hi>Vulgar Latin</hi> acknowledgeth, tranſlating the word in the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall, not <hi>excindam;</hi> (as indeed it ſignifieth) <hi>I will cut off,</hi> but <hi>disperda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I will deſtroy.</hi> So do the Seaventy Interpreters in their
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:1729:59"/> Greeke edition of the Bible, here tranſlating the Hebrew word not <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, (as indeed it ſignifieth) <hi>I will cut off;</hi> but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, I will vtterly, or altogether <hi>deſtroy, overthrowe,</hi> and <hi>extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I will cut off the inhabitant]</hi> the <hi>inhabitant?</hi> what? but one? yes, all, and every one of the <hi>inhabitants.</hi> The Holy Spirit in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Scripture vſeth ſo to ſpeake; by a word of the ſingular nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to vnderſtand more then one; yea all of that kinde, which kind of ſpeech is analogically reduced to the figure <hi>Synoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doche.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let vs ſee the truth of this in a few inſtances. In Exod. 8.6. it is ſaid; when <hi>Aaro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi> ſtretched out his hand vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the waters of <hi>Egypt,</hi> that then the <hi>frogge</hi> came vp, and covered the land. The <hi>frogge!</hi> It were ſenſeleſſe to thinke that <hi>one frogge</hi> could cover the land of Egypt; and therefore by <hi>the frogge,</hi> we are to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand <hi>many frogges.</hi> In Num. 21.7. the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> deſired <hi>Moſes</hi> to pray to the LORD, that he would take away from them the <hi>Serpent. The ſerpent!</hi> what? but one? It is out of doubt that the people meant all the <hi>fierie ſerpents</hi> ſent among them by the LORD, to ſting them to death: of which wee read verſe the 6. Ieremie in chap. 8.7. ſaith that the <hi>ſtorke,</hi> the <hi>turtle,</hi> the <hi>crane,</hi> &amp; the <hi>ſwallow</hi> doe knowe, &amp; obſerue their appointed times. The <hi>ſtorke,</hi> the <hi>turtle,</hi> the <hi>crane,</hi> the <hi>ſwallow!</hi> We may not thinke the Prophet ſingleth out <hi>one ſtorke, one turtle, one crane, one ſwallow</hi> from the reſt; but his meaning is of all <hi>ſtorkes, turtles, cranes, ſwallowes,</hi> that they knowe, &amp; obſerue their appointed times. As in the now cited places, ſo here in my text, the holy Ghoſt vſeth one number, for another; the <hi>ſingular</hi> for the <hi>plurall,</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding by <hi>one inhabitant, all the inhabitants</hi> of <hi>Bikeath-Aven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Of Bikeath-Aven]</hi> the Greek Tranſlators taking the words partly appellatiuely, and partly properly, doe render them, the <hi>field of On.</hi> In like ſort <hi>Gualter,</hi> the <hi>valley of Aven.</hi> The author of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ulgar Latin,</hi> vnderſtanding them wholy appellatiuely, rendreth them, the <hi>field of the Idol:</hi> and ſo they may ſignifie, <hi>the plaine of Aven,</hi> the <hi>plaine of griefe,</hi> the <hi>plaine of ſorrow,</hi> as <hi>Calvin</hi>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:1729:59"/> obſerveth. <hi>Innius</hi> and <hi>Tremellius</hi> doe render it, as before <hi>Gual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, è convalle Avenis,</hi> the valley of Aven: vnderſtanding there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the whole coaſt of <hi>Chamatha,</hi> which way <hi>Syria</hi> bordereth vpon <hi>Arabia,</hi> ſurnamed the <hi>Deſert.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaith it is vncertain, whether <hi>Bikeath-Aven</hi> be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per name of a place, or no; yet ſaith he, it is probable. <hi>Druſius</hi> following the <hi>Hebrew Doctors,</hi> affirmeth, that it is the proper name of a city in <hi>Syria. Mercer,</hi> the learned profeſſour of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> ioineth with him. And our Engliſh <hi>Geneva Tranſlatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi> draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vs to be of the ſame mind, that <hi>Bikeath-Aven</hi> is a proper name of a city in <hi>Syria.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſame opinion muſt we hold of <hi>Beth-Eden,</hi> in the next clauſe; that it is a proper name of a city in <hi>Syria:</hi> of which opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion I find <hi>Mercer,</hi> and <hi>Druſius,</hi> and our Engliſh <hi>Tranſlators at Geneva</hi> to haue beene. And <hi>Calvin</hi> holds it to bee credible, though he tranſlates it <hi>the houſe of Eden;</hi> ſo <hi>Gualter</hi> doth; ſo doth <hi>Tremellius,</hi> who by <hi>the houſe of Eden,</hi> vnderſtandeth the whole country of of <hi>Coeleſyria,</hi> wherein ſtood the city <hi>Eden.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The author of the Vulgar Latin takes <hi>Beth-Eden</hi> for an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellatiue, and tranſlates it, <hi>the houſe of pleaſure,.</hi> Such indeed is the ſignificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the word; and it is by <hi>Arias Montanus,</hi> &amp; <hi>Ribera,</hi> applied to ſignifie the <hi>city of Damaſcus:</hi> as if <hi>Damaſcus</hi> were there called not only <hi>Bikeath-Aven,</hi> that is, the <hi>field of the Idol;</hi> becauſe of the <hi>Idolatrie</hi> there vſed, but alſo <hi>Beth-Eden</hi> that is, <hi>the houſe of pleaſure,</hi> becauſe of the pleaſant ſituation thereof. But I retaine the proper name <hi>Beth-Eden,</hi> and take it for a city in <hi>Syria,</hi> wherein the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Syria</hi> had a palace, and manſion houſe. Which I take to be plaine in my text, where the LORD threatneth, <hi>to cut off him, that holdeth the ſcepter out of</hi> Beth-Eden.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Him that holdeth the ſcepter]</hi> that is, the <hi>King</hi> keeping his court at <hi>Beth-Eden.</hi> For I ſee not any abſurditie in it, if I ſay that the <hi>King of Syria</hi> had a manſion houſe, as well at <hi>Beth-Eden,</hi> as at <hi>Damaſcus;</hi> and that at this time the court lay at <hi>Beth-Eden.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>Firſt we ſee, that <hi>the cutting of, of the inhabitant of Bikeath-Aven, and of him that holdeth the ſcepter out of Beth-eden,</hi> is the LORDS proper worke.

            <p>This palpable idolatry of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> giving the glory of <hi>the moſt high</hi> to their baſe, and inglorious abominations, we <hi>Chriſtians</hi> muſt vtterly renounce. We honor the LORD <hi>of hoaſts</hi> alone, and to him alone do we aſcribe the ſoveraignety, domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and rule of the whole world. Such is the extent of Gods wonderfull, and eternall <hi>providence.</hi> The whole world with all things therein, is wholy, &amp; alone ſubiect to the ſoveraignety, dominion, and rule of Almighty God; by his <hi>providence</hi> all things are preſerved, all things are ruled, all things are orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>

            <p>The firſt degree, which I termed <hi>gradum conſervationis,</hi> the degree of maintenance, and preſervation, implieth thus much; that all things in generall, and every thing in particular, are by Almighty God ſuſtained ordinarily, in the ſame ſtate of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and naturall proprieties, wherein they were created.</p>

               </gap> that Almighty God for his vnlimited power, gouerneth all things in the world, and ruleth them <hi>pro libertate voluntatis ſua,</hi> even as he liſteth.</p>
            <p>This point is delivered not obſcurely in many places of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture: as in thoſe generall, and vniverſall ſayings, which doe proue God Almightie, even this day to work in the world, and to doe all in all. In Eſai 43.13. thus ſaith the LORD; <hi>Yea, before the day was, I am, and there is none, that can deliuer out of mine hand, I will doe it, and who ſhall let it?</hi> Agreeable to this are the words of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> Iohn. 5.17. <hi>My father worketh hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto, and I worke:</hi> From both theſe places we may truly inferre that God <hi>worketh</hi> in the gouernement of this world day after day, even vntill the end thereof: which <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Paul</hi> Epheſ. 1.11. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voweth; <hi>He worketh all things, after the counſaile of his owne wil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the conſideration hereof <hi>Elihu</hi> ſtirreth vp afflicted <hi>Iob</hi> chap. 37. wiſhing him to conſider the wonderous workes of God, the cloudes, and his light ſhining out of them; the thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Gods marvailous, and glorious voice; the ſnow, the froſt, the whirlewind, the raine; all theſe God ruleth, and governeth after his good pleaſure.</p>
            <p>And who I pray you ruleth man, and mans affaires, but the LORD? O LORD, ſaith Ierem. chap. 10.23. <hi>I knowe that the way of man is not in himſelfe, neither is it in man to walke, and to direct his ſteps.</hi> King <hi>Solomon</hi> confeſſeth as much, Prov. 20.24. <hi>The ſteps of man are ruled by the</hi> LORD.</p>
            <p>From this ruling providence of God, King <hi>David</hi> Pſal. 23.1. drew vnto himſelfe a very comfortable argument: <hi>The</hi> LORD <hi>feedeth me, therefore I ſhall not want.</hi> Let vs as comfortably rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with our ſelues; <hi>The</hi> LORD <hi>feedeth vs, therefore we ſhall not want.</hi> It is ſpoken to our never ending comfort by our bleſſed <hi>Saviour,</hi> Matth. 10.29. <hi>Are not two ſparrows ſold for a farthing &amp; one of them falleth not on the ground without your father?

            <p>The third degree, by which wee may diſcerne the act of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine providence, I called <hi>gradum ordinationis,</hi> the degree of <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination,</hi> or <hi>direction.</hi> It implieth thus much: that <hi>God of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable wiſdome ordeineth, &amp; ſetteth in order, whatſoever things in the world, ſeeme to be moſt out of order; hee bringeth them all to his chiefly intended end; all muſt make for his glorie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this <hi>divine ordination</hi> three things doe concurre: <hi>Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutio finis; mediorum ad finem diſpoſitio;</hi> and <hi>Dispoſitorum direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio.</hi> Firſt God <hi>appointeth an end</hi> to every thing; ſecondly hee <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſeth meanes vnto the end;</hi> thirdly hee <hi>directeth the meanes ſo diſpoſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To diſcourſe of theſe particulars ſeverally, would carry mee beyond my time, and your patience: I will but only touch the generall, which was,
<q>God of his admirable wiſdome ordaineth, or ſetteth in order, whatſoever things in the world ſeem to be moſt out of order: he bringeth them all to his chiefly intended end; they al make for his glorie.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Herevpon dependeth the truth of my propounded doctrine inviolable; <q>No calamitie, or miſerie befalleth any one, of whatſoever eſtate, or degree, by chance, or at adventure.</q>
            </p>
            <p>For if it be true, (as true it is, and the gates of Hell ſhal never be able to prevaile againſt it) that God by his wonderfull pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence maintaineth, and preſerueth, ruleth, &amp; governeth, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth, diſpoſeth, and directeth al things in this world, even to the very haires of our heads, it cannot be, that any calamitie, or miſery ſhould befall any one of vs by adventure, by hap-haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, by chance, by fortune.</p>
            <p>The Epicure in the booke of Iob, 22.13. was in a fowle er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour to thinke, that God, walking in the circle of heaven, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>through the darke cloudes</hi> ſee our miſdoings, &amp; <hi>iudge</hi> vs for
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:1729:62"/> them. Dearely beloued, wee may not thinke our God to bee a<note n="m" place="margin">See Lect. 1. pag. 10.</note> God to halfes, and in part only, a God aboue and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the moone; a God vpon the mountaines, and not in the valleys; a God in the greater, and not in the leſſer employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. We may not thus thinke.</p>
            <p>Wee haue liued long enough, to haue learned better things out of <hi>Amos</hi> 9. Ierem. 23. Pſal. 139. that God is every where preſent, and that there is no evaſion from him. No corner in Hell, no manſion in heaven, no caue in the top of <hi>Carmel,</hi> no fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes belly in the bottome of the ſea, no darke dungeon in the land of captivitie, no place of any ſecrecie any where, is able to hide vs from the preſence of God.</p>

               <hi>totus,</hi> OCVLVS, alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether <hi>eye,</hi> for he <hi>ſaith</hi> all things.

            <p>We ſhall then be very iniurious to God, if we deny him the overſight of the ſmalleſt matters.

            <p>Theſe meanes vnto eternall life are of two ſorts: 1. Some are <hi>neceſſarie vnto all,</hi> of whatſoever age, or ſexe: and they are, <hi>Chriſt,</hi> (as our mediatour, and high Prieſt) his obedience, and righteouſneſſe; our effectuall vocation vnto <hi>Chriſt</hi> by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt; our iuſtification; our glorification. Theſe are ſo <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie vnto all,</hi> that without them none can bee ſaued. And therefore <hi>all elect infants</hi> are inwardly, and after a ſecret man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner by the holy Ghoſt called, &amp; iuſtified, that they may be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified. 2. Some annexed vnto theſe are <hi>neceſſary</hi> too, but <hi>not to all.</hi> Not to <hi>infants,</hi> becauſe they are not capable of them; yet to <hi>all,</hi> that are growne to yeares of vnderſtanding; and theſe are: Actuall faith, the hearing of the word, a hatred of ſinne, the loue of righteouſneſſe, patience in adverſitie, a deſire of doing good workes. All theſe meanes, we, that are growne to years of vnderſtanding, muſt embrace, and take hold of, every one according to our capacities, or elſe wee ſhall never enter into everlaſting life; but our portion ſhall bee in that lake, which is provided for the Devill, and his Angels; from which God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie keepe vs all.</p>
            <p>Thus farre occaſioned by my firſt circumſtance, the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the <hi>puniſher;</hi> God by the King of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> ſent into <hi>captivitie the people of</hi> Aram. My doctrine was,
<q>Almightie God in his governement of the world worketh ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily by meanes, or ſecond cauſes.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond circumſtance is of the <hi>puniſhed;</hi> the <hi>Aramites</hi> of all ſorts, the ruder, and the noble. <hi>The people of Aram.</hi> To grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſome doctrine hereon, you muſt note with me the qualitie, &amp; condition of theſe <hi>Aramites.</hi> They were profeſſed enimies to the people of God.

The
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:1729:67"/> doctrine is,

            </p>
            <p>Gods holy practiſe in this kind, ſpecially regiſtred in ſundry places of his eternal word, moſt evidently declareth this truth. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were kept in the al dome, &amp; bondage, many years by the <hi>Egyptians.</hi> The <hi>Egyptians,</hi> they were but the weapons of Gods wrath, wherewith he afflicted his people; they were Gods weapons: were they therefore to eſcape vnpuniſhed?

            <p>
               <hi>Ahab,</hi> the moſt wicked of the Kings of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who ſold him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to worke wickedneſſe in the ſight of the LORD, and his accurſed wife, <hi>Iezebel,</hi> were Gods <hi>inſtruments</hi> to afflict <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both</hi> with the loſſe of his life, and vineyard. <hi>Ahab,</hi> and <hi>Ieze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,</hi> were Gods <hi>inſtruments.</hi> Were they therefore to eſcape vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſhed?

            </p>
            <p>The reaſon hereof is; becauſe Gods iuſtice cannot let them eſcape vnpuniſhed. <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Paule</hi> expreſſeth it, 2.

            <p>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Peter</hi> to make vs ſtedfaſt in this comfort, diſputeth this point, Ep. 1. chap. 4.17. The point he proueth by an argument drawne <hi>à minori,</hi> inferring from a truth to carnal mens vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding leſſe probable, a truth of greater probabilitie. <hi>Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>beginneth at the houſe of God; If it firſt begin at vs what ſhall be the end of them, which obey not the Goſpell of God? And if the righteous ſcarſly be ſaued, where ſhall the vngodly, and the ſinner appeare?</hi> Our Saviours words, Luk. 23.31. do co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taine a like argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: <hi>If they doe theſe things to a greene tree, what ſhal be done to the dry?</hi> To like purpoſe in Ierem. 25.29. ſaith the LORD of hoaſts: <hi>Loe I begin to plague the city, where my name is called vpon, &amp; ſhall you goe free? Yee ſhall not goe free.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hitherto I refer alſo one other text, Eſai 10.12. where it is ſaid, that God, when he hath done, &amp; diſpatched all his worke vpon <hi>mount Sion, will viſite the fruite of the proud heart
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:1729:68"/> of the King of Aſſyria;</hi> the meaning of the place is, that God, when he hath ſufficiently ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſtiſed, and corrected thoſe of his owne houſe, his beloued children, wil turne his ſword againſt the skorners of his Maieſtie. When God hath ſerued his owne turne by the <hi>wicked,</hi> then comes their turne alſo; howſoever for a while they flouriſh, in hope to eſcape Gods hand, and to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide vnpuniſhed, yet will God in due time well enough finde them out, to pay them double.</p>
            <p>The vſes of this doctrine I can but point at. One is, to admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh vs, that we ſpite not any of the wicked, who now doe liue in reſt, becauſe their turne to be puniſhed, muſt come, and faile not. The further it is put of from them, the heavier in the end it will fall vpon them.</p>
            <p>A ſecond vſe is, to teach vs patience in afflictions; for as much as God will ſhortly cauſe the cuppe to paſſe from vs to our adverſaries. But ſay, he wil not. Yet nevertheleſſe are we to poſſeſſe our ſoules in patience; reioicing and giving thankes to God, who hath made vs worthy, not only to belieue in him, but alſo to ſuffer for his ſake. For we haue learned, Act. 14.22. <hi>That through many afflictions we muſt enter into the kingdome of God, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Prophets, and Apoſtles, and Martyrs, which were, not only reviled, and ſcourged; but alſo beheaded, cut in pieces, drowned in water, conſumed in fire, by other tyrannicall devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes cruelly put to death, they all by this way received the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt token of their happy, and bleſſed eſtate, and entred into the kingdome of God. And we vndoubtedly know, 2. Cor. 5.1. <hi>That if our earthly houſe of this tabernacle be deſtroyed, wee haue a building of God, an houſe not made with hands, but eternal in the heavens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus farre of my ſecond circumſtance; the circumſtance of <hi>the puniſhed,</hi> the <hi>Aramites,</hi> profeſſed enemies vnto God, yet by him employed in the correction of his owne children, the <hi>Iſraelits,</hi> are here themſelues puniſhed. My doctrine was,
<q>Though the Lord do vſe his enemies, as inſtruments, to correct his owne ſervants, and children; yet will he in due time over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:1729:68"/> thoſe his enemies, with a large meaſure of his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The third circumſtance is, the <hi>puniſhment,</hi> a <hi>going into capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitie:</hi> amplified by the place. This <hi>captivity,</hi> bondage, and ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, was to be in an vnknowne, ſtrange, &amp; a farre country; <hi>Kir</hi> in <hi>Media.</hi> The people of <hi>Aram</hi> ſhal goe into captivity vnto <hi>Kir.</hi> The doctrine is,
<q>For the ſinne of a land, God often times ſendeth away the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants into captivity.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Captivity</hi> to be an effect, or puniſhment of ſin, king <hi>Salomon</hi> in his praier made to the LORD at his conſecration, or dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Temple,</hi> 1. King. 8.46. acknowledgeth. It's expreſlie delivered, 1.

            <p>I let paſſe the multitude of Scripture-places ſerving to this point; my text is plaine for it.

            <p>The firſt wich I call the <hi>spirituall captivity,</hi> and a <hi>captivitie</hi> of the minde, is a <hi>captivity</hi> vnder the Devill, vnder the power of Hell, vnder death, vnder ſin, vnder the eternall malediction, or curſe of the law, propounded to every one, that doth not in all points, and abſolutely, obey the law.

Cor. 15.55. <hi>O death, where is thy ſting? O Hell, where is thy victory? the ſting of death is ſin, and the ſtrength of ſinne is the law. But thanks be to God, who hath given vs victory, through Ieſus Chriſt our</hi> LORD.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Captivity</hi> in my text, is of the other kind, <hi>a corporal cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity,</hi> a <hi>captivity</hi> of the body, which vſually is accompanied with two great miſeries, pointed at, Pſal. 107.10. The firſt, <hi>they dwell in darknes, and in the ſhadow of death;</hi> the ſecond, <hi>they are bound in anguiſh, and yron.</hi> Firſt <hi>they dwell in darkeneſſe, and in the ſhadow of death,</hi> that is, they are put into deepe dungeons, void of light, whereby they are as it were at deaths doore. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <hi>they are bound in anguiſh, and yron,</hi> that is, day and night they are loaden with fetters, gyues, or ſhackles of
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:1729:69"/> yron; ſo loaden, that they finde no reſt vnto their bones. Thus muſt it be with them, who by ſinnefull living provoke the LORD to high diſpleaſure. Thus is my doctrine confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
<q>For the ſin of a land, God oftentimes ſendeth away the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants into captivity.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Is it true, beloved?

It is not to bee imagined.</p>

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:1729:73"/> heinouſnes of that ſin, wherwith the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> are charged. It was the ſin of <hi>cruelty</hi> in a very high degree.</p>
            <p>It is a <hi>cruell</hi> deed to carry away any one fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his natiue cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; but him, that is ſo carried away, to ſell to his mortall ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, this is a <hi>cruelty,</hi> then which there cannot be a greater. Such was the ſin of thoſe <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> the inhabitants of <hi>Azzah.</hi> They ſold, whether the <hi>Iewes,</hi> or the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> the poſterity of <hi>Iacob,</hi> and ſervants of the <hi>living God,</hi> to their profeſſed enemies, the <hi>Edomites,</hi> with this policie, that being carried far fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their own country, they ſhould liue in <hi>eternal ſlavery,</hi> &amp; <hi>bondage,</hi> without hope ever to returne home againe.</p>
            <p>This very crime of <hi>cruelty,</hi> is in the prophecie of <hi>Ioel</hi> alſo ch. 3.6. laid to the charge of theſe <hi>Philiſtines: The children of Iudah, and the children of Ieruſalem, haue yee ſold to the Grecians, that yee might ſend them far from their border:</hi> that is, Gods inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, his owne ſeed, and ſervants, the children of <hi>Iudah,</hi> &amp; <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> the cruell and hard hearted Philiſtines did mancipate, and ſell away for bondſlaues to the Grecians dwelling farre of, that with them they might liue in <hi>perpetuall ſervitude,</hi> and <hi>ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verie,</hi> without all hope of <hi>liberty,</hi> or <hi>redemption.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now in this that the LORD calleth the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> to a rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning, becauſe they had ſolde away <hi>his people,</hi> though they were <hi>their captiues,</hi> vnto <hi>infidels:</hi> we may learne this leſſon.</p>
            <q>It is not lawful to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit the children of beleevers into the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds of infidels.</q>
            <p>The vnlawfulneſſe hereof appeareth by the charge, which <hi>Moſes</hi> giveth the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> Deut. 7.3. His charge is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the <hi>Hittites,</hi> the <hi>Gergaſites,</hi> the <hi>Amorites,</hi> the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> the <hi>Perizzites,</hi> the <hi>Hivits,</hi> and the <hi>Iebuſites,</hi> that they ſhould not at al make any covenant with them, nor giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their children in <hi>marriage.</hi> And why ſo? Becauſe by ſuch <hi>covenants,</hi> &amp; <hi>marriages,</hi> they might be withdrawn from the true ſervice of God, to the prophane worſhip of Idols. For ſo it's ſaide verſe the 4. <hi>They will cauſe thy ſonne to turne away from me, &amp; to ſerue other Gods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The danger of ſuch <hi>covenants,</hi> and <hi>marriages, S. Paule</hi> knew to be very great, and therefore from ſuch he dehorteth the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi>

            <p>In like caſe it is with men. They that fall into familiarity with the wicked, do couple themſelues with them, &amp; ſo are led out of the way, and made to worke wickedneſſe before the LORD. From this <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Remember I beſeech you: <hi>righteouſneſſe hath no fellowſhip with vnrighteouſnes, light hath no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion with darknes;</hi> Chriſt <hi>is not at concord with</hi> Belial; <hi>the beleever hath no part with the infidell; there is no agreement betweene the Temple of God and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols;</hi> therefore may we not <hi>enter into familiaritie, with the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, prophane, and idolatrous;</hi> we may not make any <hi>covena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t</hi> with them; we may not giue them our children in <hi>marriage.</hi> Thus is my doctrine confirmed:
<q>It is not lawfull to commit the children of beleevers into the hands of infidels. <hi>Now to the vſes.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt ſerveth for our inſtruction; &amp; teacheth vs ſo to loue the <hi>ſoules</hi> of <hi>the righteous ſeed,</hi> that we leaue them not reſident among <hi>Infidels,</hi> or <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> or <hi>Papiſts,</hi> or any <hi>prophane wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches:</hi> but rather, that to our labour, and coſt, wee redeeme them
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:1729:75"/> out of the <hi>Devils tyranny.</hi> We muſt haue a ſingular care for the <hi>children</hi> which are borne amonge vs, that they be godly, and vertuouſly brought vp, and ſo provided for, that they may doe <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſome ſervice in the Church, and Common wealth.</p>
            <p>Our Saviour his words, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.6. are true without excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <hi>Whoſoever ſhall offend one of theſe little ones, which beleeue in me, it were better for him that a milſtone were hanged about his necke, &amp; that he were drowned in the depth of the ſea.</hi> What mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure then are we to looke for, if wee bequeath our children to the ſervice of men of corrupt conſciences, and wicked affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſuch as will compaſſe heaven, and earth, to make anie one the childe of damnation?</p>
            <p>A ſecond vſe may be, for the reproofe of ſuch as do binde, &amp; put their <hi>children,</hi> the fruit of their bodies, (which they ought to conſecrate to the LORD) into the education of open ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the goſpell of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> moſt blaſphemous, and abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Atheiſts; or moſt blind and ſuperſtitious Papiſts. Are not theſe as much to be complained of, as thoſe, whom the LORD here condemneth for ſelling of <hi>Iſraels ſeed into the hands of the Edomites?</hi> Yes, &amp; much more. For thoſe ſold their enemies, but our men ſell their children; thoſe did it by the law of warre, but our men doe it contrary to the law of God; thoſe in doing as they did, did not ſinne againſt their knowledge; but our men in doing as they do, do ſinne againſt their conſcience.</p>
            <p>Vnhappy parents, which deſtroy your <hi>children</hi> in <hi>Popiſh,</hi> and <hi>Atheiſticall</hi> houſes! What are you inferiour to them, that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed their children vnto Devils? If your ſelues be <hi>righteous,</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> caſt not away your <hi>ſeed,</hi> your <hi>children,</hi> the price of the precious bloud of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> You haue made them in their <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they were yong, <hi>to confeſſe</hi> Chriſt: will you make them now, growne to yeares, <hi>to deny</hi> Chriſt? O, let the words of wiſe <hi>Eccleſiaſticus,</hi> chap. 13.1. be precious in your memories: <hi>He that toucheth pitch ſhall be defiled therewith:</hi> and doubtleſſe your <hi>children</hi> placed in <hi>Atheiſticall,</hi> or <hi>Popiſh</hi> houſes, wil them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues become <hi>Atheiſticall,</hi> or <hi>Popiſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Suffer, I beſeech you, a word of exhortation in your <hi>childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s</hi>
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:1729:75"/> behalfe.

            </p>
            <p>A third vſe. Is it not lawfull to commit the <hi>children</hi> of <hi>belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> into the <hi>hands</hi> of <hi>infidels,</hi> for the reaſon aboue ſpecified, <hi>that they be not withdrawne fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the true ſervice of God?</hi> The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it lawfull for <hi>you</hi> of <hi>your ſelues</hi> to keepe away <hi>your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,</hi> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>the ſervice of God.</hi> It is reputed for a tyrannie in <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh,</hi> Exod. 5.3, 4. That <hi>he would not ſuffer the children of Iſrael to go three daies iourney into the deſert to ſacrifice to the</hi> LORD, <hi>their God:</hi> &amp; how can you free your ſelues from the impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>tyrannie,</hi> if you deny your <hi>ſervants</hi> to go but one <hi>houres iourney,</hi> to this place, <hi>to ſerue their God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thinke it not enough, that <hi>your ſelues</hi> come hither to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme <hi>ſome duty</hi> to <hi>Chriſt your</hi> LORD, <hi>&amp; Maſter;</hi> how ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you performe <hi>your duty</hi> to him, if you deny him your <hi>ſervants?</hi> You know what charge is given you in the fourth commandement; not <hi>your ſelues</hi> only, but alſo <hi>your ſonnes,</hi> and <hi>your daughters,</hi> &amp; <hi>your ſervants, men,</hi> and <hi>maidens,</hi> and the <hi>ſtranger that ſoiourneth with you,</hi> are to <hi>hallow,</hi> and <hi>Sanctifie the Sabbaoth day with the Lords ſervice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this holy worke and ſervice of God <hi>vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Sabbaoth day,</hi> regarde not what the multitude, and greater ſort of men doe. Suppoſe all the world beſides <hi>your ſelues,</hi> would be careleſſe to performe <hi>this duty;</hi> yet let your holy reſolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be the ſame with <hi>Ioſhua's,</hi> chap. 24.15. <hi>I, and my houſe wil ſerue the Lord.</hi> Thus far of my firſt doctrine, grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded vpon God's diſlike with the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtines,</hi> for <hi>ſelling away the</hi> Iſraelites, <hi>his faithfull people, into the hands of the</hi> Edomites, <hi>an vnbeleeving nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To ground a ſecond doctrine hereon; wee are to note, that the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> ſold away the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to the <hi>Idumaeans,</hi> at ſuch time as they were <hi>their captiues:</hi> &amp; ſo did adde affliction to the afflicted. The doctrine is,
<q>It is a very grievous thing, to adde affliction to the afflicted.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Witneſſe the complaint made by the <hi>captiue Iewes</hi> againſt
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:1729:76"/> the inſolencie of the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> Pſal. 137.3. <hi>They that led vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way captiue required of vs ſongs, and mirth in our heavineſſe, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; ſing vs one of the ſongs of</hi> Sion. <hi>They]</hi> the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonians,</hi> and <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> in whoſe country we were priſoners, <hi>required of vs]</hi> ſcornefully, and diſdainefully, thereby to adde to our griefes: <hi>they required of vs ſongs]</hi> ſuch <hi>ſongs,</hi> as wee were wont to ſing in <hi>Sion, Ieruſalem,</hi> and our <hi>owne country</hi> before the deſtruction of the Temple, and our captivitie. <hi>They requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of vs,</hi> not <hi>ſongs</hi> only, <hi>but mirth alſo]</hi> they ſcoffingly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired vs to be merry, when they ſaw vs ſo heavy hearted, as nothing could make vs glad. <hi>They required of vs ſongs &amp; mirth in our heavineſſe, ſaying; ſing vs one of the ſongs of</hi> Sion] <hi>ſing</hi> for vs, or in our hearing, ſome one, or other of thoſe ſongs, which you were wont to <hi>ſing</hi> in <hi>Sion,</hi> when you were at home in your owne country.</p>
            <p>Intolerable is the hard heartedneſſe, cruelty, and ſcoffing nature of the wicked, when they haue gotten Gods children into their nets. God cannot away with ſuch vnmercifulneſſe, and want of pity. He reproueth it in the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> Eſai, 47.6. where thus ſaith the LORD, <hi>I was wroth with my people, I haue polluted mine inheritance, and giuen them into thine hand: thou didſt ſhew them no mercy; but thou didſt lay thy very heavy yoke vpon the ancient:</hi> therefore now heare, deſtruction ſhall come vpon thee. <hi>Magna abominatio coram Deo eſt, afflicto ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere afflictionem; clamat<expan>

Yea, we are aſſured by Pſalm. 102.19. that the LORD <hi>looketh downe from the height of his ſanctuarie, and out of heaven beholdeth the earth,</hi> that he may <hi>heare,</hi> and ſo take pitie of the ſighings, groanings, and lamentable cryes of ſuch his people, as are in affliction.</p>
            <p>The time will not ſuffer me now to trouble you with more texts of <hi>Scripture;</hi> let the now alleaged be ſufficient to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firme my propounded doctrine, that <hi>it is a grievous thing to adde af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:1729:76"/> to the afflicted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The vſes of this doctrine, I can but point at. One is, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue the <hi>Nimrods,</hi> and tyrants of this world, which haue no <hi>pitie,</hi> no <hi>compaſſion</hi> vpon <hi>the poore,</hi> and <hi>diſtreſſed.</hi> Such in the end ſhall knowe by their owne lamentable experience, that to bee true, which <hi>Solomon</hi> hath vttered, Prov. 21.13. <hi>He that ſtoppeth his eare at the crying of the poore, ſhall cry himſelfe and not bee heard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A ſecond vſe is to ſtirre vs vp to the performance of this our Chriſtian dutie, even to take pity vpon all, that are in any kind of miſerie: if our neighbours be deſtitute of ayd and helpe, wee may not like wild beaſts, lift vp our ſelues againſt them, and ſo tread them vnder foot. No. How dare wee moleſt, and trouble them, whom by Gods appointment we are to relieue, and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour? We are commanded, Deut. 15.11. to <hi>open our hands to the needy, and poore, that are in our land:</hi> to open our hands to them for their helpe, and ſuccour.</p>
            <p>It is not enough for vs to <hi>abſteine</hi> from all <hi>iniury,</hi> &amp; <hi>harme-doing</hi> but withall muſt we endevour to <hi>relieue the oppreſſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This ſervice of ours will be acceptable vnto God. God for it will giue vs his bleſſing: God will bleſſe vs for the time of our being here; and when the <hi>day of our diſſolution</hi> ſhall be, that wee muſt leaue this <hi>earthly tabernacle,</hi> then will the Sonne of man, ſitting vpon the throne of his glory, welcome vs with a <hi>venite benedicti; Come yee bleſſed of my father, inherite yee the kingdome prepared for you from the foundations of the world. For I was an hungred, and yee gaue me meate; I thirſted, and ye gaue me drinke; I was a ſtranger, and ye lodged me; I was naked, &amp; yee cloathed me; I was ſicke, and yee viſited me; I was in priſon, and yee came vnto me;</hi> in as much as you haue done theſe things to the needy, and diſtreſſed, yee haue done them vnto me. <hi>Come yee bleſſed of my Father inherite the kingdome prepared for you from the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the world.</hi>

            </list>
            <p>The <hi>puniſher</hi> is the LORD, for thus ſaith the LORD, <hi>I will ſend.</hi> The note yeeldeth vs this doctrine.</p>
            <q>It is proper to the Lord to execute vengeance vpon the wicked for their ſins.</q>
            <p>This doctrine I proved at large in my eighth lecture vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this prophecie. Yet for their ſakes, who then heard me not, or haue forgotten, what then they heard, I will by a few texts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:1729:77"/> againe confirme it vnto you: <hi>It is proper to the</hi> LORD <hi>to execute vengeance vpon the wicked for their ſinnes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This office of <hi>executing vengeance vpon the wicked for their ſinnes,</hi> God arrogateth and aſſumeth to himſelfe, Deut. 32.35. where he ſaith, <hi>vengeance, and recompence are mine.</hi> This due is aſcribed vnto the LORD by S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Paule,</hi> Rom. 12.19. <hi>It is written vengeance is mine, I will repay ſaith the</hi> LORD. By the author of the Epiſtle to the Hebrewes, chap. 10.30. <hi>Vengeance belongeth vnto me, I will recompenſe, ſaith the</hi> LORD. By the ſweet ſinger Pſal. 94.1. <hi>O</hi> LORD, <hi>God, the avenger, O God the avenger.</hi> The Prophet <hi>Nahum</hi> trebleth the phraſe, chap. 1.2. <hi>The</hi> LORD <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeth; the</hi> LORD <hi>revengeth, the</hi> LORD <hi>will take vengeance on his adverſaries.</hi> Theſe few texts of holy writ doe firmely proue my doctrine: <hi>It is proper to the</hi> LORD <hi>to execute vengea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce vpon the wicked for their ſinnes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One vſe of this doctrine is; to teach vs heedfulneſſe in al our waies; that we doe not worke wickedneſſe before the LORD, and ſo provoke him to <hi>execute his vengeance</hi> on vs. Beloued, let vs not forget it: though God be good, gracious, mercifull, and long ſuffering yet is he alſo a iuſt God, <hi>God the avenger,</hi> &amp; <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſher.</hi> It is <hi>proper vnto him to execute vengeance vpon the wicked for their ſinnes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A ſecond vſe is, to admoniſh vs not to intermeddle in the Lords office. It's his office <hi>to execute vengeance;</hi> wee therefore may not do it. If a brother, or neighbour, or ſtranger, do wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g vs, it is our part <hi>to forgiue him,</hi> and leaue <hi>revengement</hi> to God, to whome it appertaineth. To this Chriſtian, and charitable courſe, our Saviour worketh vs by a ſtrong argument, Matth. 6.15. <hi>If yee doe not forgiue men their trespaſſes, no more will your father forgiue you your trespaſſes.</hi> Forgiue, and you ſhall be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given; forgiue not, and yee ſhall never bee forgiuen.</p>
            <p>Wherefore (dearely beloved) ſuffer your ſelues to be exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as the <hi>Romans</hi> were by <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Paul,</hi> chap, 12.19. <hi>Dearely belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, if it be poſſible, as much as in you is, haue peace with all men; recompenſe to no man evill for evill: avenge not your ſelues, but giue place vnto wrath, for it is written: vengeance is mine, I will
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:1729:78"/> repay ſaith the</hi> LORD. It is <hi>proper to the Lord to execute venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance vpon the wicked for their ſinnes.</hi> Here wee ſee, that for the ſinnes of the <hi>Philiſtines.</hi> God reſolueth to ſend a <hi>fire</hi> to <hi>devoure their wals and palaces.</hi> This was my ſecond crcumſtance; the circumſtance of the puniſhment: <hi>I will ſend a fire.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many deſolations hath God wrought by <hi>fire.</hi> By <hi>fire</hi> he laid waſt <hi>Sodom, Gomorah,</hi> and their <hi>ſiſter cities,</hi> Gen. 19.24. By <hi>fire</hi> he did eate vp <hi>Nadab,</hi> and <hi>Abihu,</hi> Levit. 10.2. By <hi>fire,</hi> he cut of the two hundred and fiftie men, that were in the rebellio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Korah,</hi> Num. 16.35. By <hi>fire</hi> he devoured two captaines, &amp; twiſe fiftie men, 2. King 1 10. &amp; 12. Why doe I load your memories with multitude of examples for this point? My text telleth you that <hi>fire,</hi> God's creature, becommeth God's inſtrument, &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutioner of his vengeance for the ſinnes of <hi>Azzah,</hi> to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume her wals, and devoure her palaces.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I will ſend a fire]</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">See lect. 8.</note> By <hi>fire</hi> in this place, as verſe the 4. the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned expoſitors doe vnderſtand, not only <hi>naturall fire,</hi> but alſo the <hi>ſword,</hi> and <hi>peſtilence,</hi> and <hi>famine: quodlibet genus conſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis,</hi> every kind of conſumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, every <hi>ſcourge,</hi> wherewith God puniſheth the wicked, be it <hi>haile,</hi> or <hi>thunder,</hi> or <hi>ſickneſſe,</hi> or any other of God's meſſengers. So large is the ſignification of <hi>fire</hi> in the metaphoricall vnderſtanding. The doctrine is,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The fire,</hi> (whether <hi>naturall,</hi> or <hi>Metaphoricall</hi>) that is, <hi>The fire, and all other creatures, are at the</hi> LORD'S <hi>commandement, to be employed by him in the puniſhment of the wicked.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A truth heretofore proued vnto you, as out of other places of holy writ, ſo out of the ſtory of God's viſitation vpon <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh,</hi> and the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> Exod. 8, 9, and 10. chapters, whereby you knowe, that <hi>frogges, lice, flies, graſhoppers, thunder, haile, lightning, murraine, botches,</hi> &amp; <hi>ſores,</hi> did inſtrumentally <hi>avenge</hi> God vpon man, and beaſts in <hi>Egypt.</hi> I ſtand not now to enlarge this proofe.</p>
            <p>The vſe of this doctrine is; to teach vs, how to behaue our ſelues, at ſuch times as God ſhal <hi>viſit vs with his rod of correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> how to carry our ſelues in all <hi>our afflictions.</hi> We muſt not ſo much look to the <hi>inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts</hi> as to the LORD, that ſmiteth by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:1729:78"/> If the <hi>fire,</hi> or <hi>water,</hi> or any other of God's <hi>creatures,</hi> ſhal at any time rage, and prevaile againſt vs, we muſt remember that it is God, that ſendeth them, to worke his holy will vpon vs. Here he <hi>ſent a fire vpon</hi> Azzah, <hi>to conſume her wals, and devoure her palaces.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here you haue my third circumſtance; the circumſtance of the <hi>puniſhed:</hi> in theſe words; <hi>the wals of</hi> Azzah, <hi>and the palaces thereof] Azzah</hi> one of the fiue provinces, or dutchies of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laeſtina,</hi> and a city of the ſame name, as I ſhewed you in my laſt lecture. The wals and palaces here mentioned, doe ſignifie thus much; that the city <hi>Azzah</hi> was well fortified, and beautified with ſumptuous buildings? Yet muſt <hi>Azzah,</hi> notwithſtanding the <hi>beauty of her buildings,</hi> and <hi>ſtrength of her ſtrong holds,</hi> be <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured with fire. I will ſend a fire vpon the wall of</hi> Azzah, <hi>&amp; it ſhall devoure the palaces thereof.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The great city <hi>Azzah</hi> for all her ſtrong wals, muſt ſhee be ſpoyled? The doctrine to be learned from hence, is:
<q>No munition can ſaue that city, which God will haue deſtroyed.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The reaſon is; becauſe there is no <hi>ſtrength</hi> but of <hi>God,</hi> &amp; fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>God.</hi> For what are all the <hi>munitions</hi> in the world to the <hi>great God of Heaven, and earth?</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">Pſal. 68.2.</note> As the ſmoake vaniſheth, ſo do they vaniſh; and as the waxe melteth before the fire, ſo melt they at the breath of the LORD. The <hi>munitions</hi> of <hi>Edom</hi> they faile be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him. <hi>Edom,</hi> the kingdome of <hi>Edom,</hi> vpon which God <hi>ſtret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the line of vanitie, and the ſtones of emptines,</hi> as witneſſeth the Prophet <hi>Eſai,</hi> cha. 34.11. It is no more a kingdome; it brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth forth thornes in her palaces; nettles, and thiſtles in her ſtrong holds. The <hi>munitions</hi> of <hi>Edom</hi> are vaniſhed as ſmoake.</p>
            <p>The <hi>munitions</hi> of <hi>Moab,</hi> they faile before him. <hi>Moab,</hi> the kingdome of <hi>Moab,</hi> had a <hi>ſtrong ſtaffe, and beautifull rod,</hi> as ſpeaketh <hi>Ier.</hi> chap. 48.17. but they are broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. <hi>Moab</hi> is deſtroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, his cities are burnt vp, his ſtrong holds are gone. The <hi>muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of <hi>Moab,</hi> are vaniſhed as ſmoake.</p>
            <p>The <hi>munitions</hi> of <hi>Iſrael</hi> faile before him. <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the kingdome of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> was God's peculiar, and ſhadowed vnder the wings of his protection: yet at length infected with the leproſie of ſin,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:1729:79"/> they were ſpoiled of their ſtrong holds; ſo ſaith <hi>Hoſeah,</hi> chap. 10.14. <hi>A tumult ſhall ariſe among the people, and all thy muniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſhall bee deſtroyed.</hi> The <hi>munitions</hi> of <hi>Iſrael</hi> are vaniſhed as ſmoake.</p>
            <p>The <hi>munitions</hi> of <hi>Iudah</hi> faile before him. <hi>Iudah,</hi> the kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e of <hi>Iudah,</hi> great amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the nations, &amp; a princeſſe amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, ſhee is now become tributary, as complaineth the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>Lament.</hi> 1.1. <hi>The</hi> LORD <hi>hath deſtroyed</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">Lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. 2.2.</note> 
               <hi>all the habitations of Iaacob, and hath not ſpared, he hath throwne downe in his wrath the ſtrong holds of the daughter of</hi> Iudah; <hi>hee hath caſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> downe to the ground.</hi> The <hi>munitions</hi> of <hi>Iudah,</hi> are vaniſhed as ſmoake. Let theſe few inſtances in the ſtates of <hi>Edom, Moab, Iſrael,</hi> &amp; <hi>Iudah,</hi> ſerue for proofe of my doctrine,
<q>No munition can ſaue that city, which God will haue deſtroied.</q>
            </p>
            <p>You will reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber the reaſon of it; becauſe <hi>there is not ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth,</hi> but <hi>of God,</hi> and <hi>from God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The vſe of this doctrine is, to teach vs, never to truſt in <hi>anie worldly helpe,</hi> but ſo to vſe all good meanes of our <hi>defenſe,</hi> that ſtill we relie vpon the LORD for <hi>ſtrength</hi> and <hi>ſucceſſe</hi> thereby. Beloved in the LORD, we haue learned, that a <hi>horſe</hi> his <hi>helpe</hi> is vaine, Pſal. 33.17. that <hi>mans helpe</hi> is vaine, Pſal. 60.11. that the <hi>helpe of Princes</hi> is vaine, Pſalme, 146.3. that <hi>much ſtrength</hi> is vaine, 2. Chron. 25.7. that <hi>much wealth</hi> is vaine, Pſal. 49.6. that all <hi>worldly helps</hi> are vaine, <hi>Eſai:</hi> 30.1. All vnder God is <hi>vanity.</hi> Wherfore now, and all other times, let our truſt be only in the name of the LORD, who hath made heaven, &amp; earth. Thus much of my firſt doctrine grounded vpon the thirde circumſtance of this 7. verſe, the circumſtance of the puniſhed, <hi>No munition can ſaue that city which God will haue deſtroyed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againe this overthrow of the wals of <hi>Azzah</hi> in Gods an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, teacheth vs thus much,
<q>It is the good bleſſing of God vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a kingdome, to haue wals, ſtrong holds, <hi>munitions, fortreſſes, and bulwarkes,</hi> for a defenſe againſt enemies.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The reaſon is, becauſe theſe be the meanes, which God vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally bleſſeth, to procure outward ſafety.</p>
            <pb n="149" facs="tcp:1729:79"/>
            <p>The vſe is to teach vs carefully to prepare ſuch againſt time of trouble: yet with this caution, that we reſt not in them, but depend wholy vpon <hi>Gods</hi> bleſſing.</p>
            <p>And here we are to poure out our ſoules in thankfulnes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Almighty God, for bleſſing this our country with the ſtrength of <hi>wals;</hi> of <hi>wals</hi> by ſea, and <hi>wals</hi> by land; by ſea with <hi>ſhips,</hi> &amp; at land with <hi>ſtrong-holds,</hi> caſtles, and fortreſſes; by ſea, &amp; land, with men of wiſdome, and valour, to bid battle to the proudeſt enemy, that dare advance himſelfe againſt vs. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe we with <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 18.2. The LORD <hi>is our rocke, our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſe, he that delivereth vs, our God, our ſtrength, our ſhield, the horne of our ſalvation, and our refuge.</hi> In him we truſt, and<note n="d" place="margin">Pſal. 56.11.</note> feare not, what <hi>man</hi> can do vnto vs.</p>
            <p>Yet further. The <hi>fire</hi> in Gods anger devouring the palaces of <hi>Azzah,</hi> teacheth vs, that,
<q>God depriveth vs of a great bleſſing, when he taketh from vs our dwelling houſes.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This doctrine I commended to you in my <hi>eighth lecture</hi> vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this prophecie. The truth is experimentally made good vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, by that great commodity, or contentment, that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to every one of vs by our dwelling houſes.</p>
            <p>The vſe of this doctrine is threefold. It teacheth vs, 1. to bee humbled before Almighty God, whenſoever <hi>our dwelling hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> are taken from vs, 2. ſince we peaceably enioy <hi>our dwelling houſes,</hi> to vſe them for the furthera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of Gods glory, 3. to praiſe God continually for the comfortable vſe wee haue of <hi>our dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling houſes.</hi> Thus farre of the 7. verſe. The 8. followeth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And I wil cut of the inhabitant from Aſhdod, &amp; him that hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the ſccpter from</hi> Aſhkelon] <hi>Aſhdod</hi> &amp; <hi>Aſhkelon,</hi> were two chiefe cities of <hi>Palaeſtina.</hi> One of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as here it appeareth, was the place of reſidence for the chiefe ruler over that ſtate. To both, <hi>Aſhdod</hi> and <hi>Aſhkelon,</hi> to the inhabitants of <hi>Aſhdod,</hi> and the ſcepter-bearer in <hi>Aſhkelon,</hi> to king, and ſubiect, Gods ſore iudgement, even <hi>a cutting of,</hi> is here threatned.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I will cut of the inhabitant of</hi> Aſhdod] Of the like iudgement in the ſame words you haue heard before in the 5. verſe threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:1729:80"/> to the <hi>Syrians, I will cut of the inhabitant of</hi> Bikeath-Aven, <hi>and him that holdeth the ſcepter out of</hi> Beth-eden. The words I then expounded at large: the briefe or ſumme whereof, is:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I]</hi> the LORD, IEHOVAH, <hi>will cut of]</hi> will vtterly deſtroy, &amp; root out, <hi>the inhabitant]</hi> not one alone, but all, and every one of the inhabitants, <hi>of Aſhdod]</hi> one of the fiue chiefe cities of the <hi>Philiſtines: And I will</hi> vtterly deſtroy, or root out, <hi>him that hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the ſcepter]</hi> the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> their chiefe ruler; their King, making his reſidence at <hi>Aſhkelon]</hi> an other of the fiue cities of <hi>Palaeſtina. I will cut of the inhabitant of</hi> Aſhdod, <hi>and him that holdeth the ſcepter from</hi> Aſhkelon.]</p>
            <p>In the words I obſerue, as before, three circumſtances.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1 The puniſher, the LORD; <hi>I.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2 The puniſhment, a cutting of; <hi>I will cut of.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3 The puniſhed, the inhabitants of <hi>Aſhdod,</hi> and the ſcepter bearer of <hi>Aſhkelon.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>By the firſt circumſtance, (the LORD himſelfe taking venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance into his owne hands,) you may bee remembred of a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, often commended to you in this, and other lectures.</p>
            <q>It is proper to the <hi>LORD</hi> to execute vengeance vpon the wicked for their ſinnes.</q>
            <p>From al three circumſtances, of the <hi>puniſher,</hi> the <hi>puniſhment,</hi> and the <hi>puniſhed</hi> iointly conſidered, we may take a profitable leſſon. We ſee that the <hi>cutting off of the inhabitants of</hi> Aſhdod, <hi>and of him that holdeth the ſcepter from</hi> Aſhkelon, is the <hi>Lords</hi> proper worke. The leſſon which we learne from hence is,
<q>No calamitie or miſery, befalleth any one of whatſoever eſtate, or degree, by chance, or at adventure.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This doctrine I handled at large in my <hi>tenth Lecture.</hi> The truth of it dependeth vpon this propoſition.</p>
            <q>The whole world, with all things therein, is wholy &amp; alone ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to the ſoueraignty, dominion, and rule of almighty God; by whoſe providence all things are preſerued, all things are ruled, all things are ordered.</q>
            <p>Theſe were the three degrees, by which I told you, you might diſcerne and take notice of the act of divine providence. The
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:1729:80"/> firſt was <hi>gradus conſervationis;</hi> the ſecond <hi>gradus gubernatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis;</hi> the third was <hi>gradus ordinationis;</hi> the firſt degree was the degree of <hi>maintenance</hi> or <hi>preſervation;</hi> the ſecond degree was the degree of <hi>rule</hi> or <hi>gouernement;</hi> the third degree was the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of <hi>ordination</hi> or <hi>direction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt implieth thus much, that
<q>All things in generall, and every thing in particular, are by Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God ſuſtained ordinarily in the ſame ſtate of nature and naturall proprieties, wherein they were created.</q>

            <p>The ſecond thus much, that
<q>Almightie God for his vnlimited power governeth all things in the world, and ruleth them, <hi>pro libertate voluntatis ſuae,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as he liſteth.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The third thus much, that
<q>God of his admirable wiſedome ordaineth, and ſetteth in order, whatſoever things in the world ſeeme to be moſt out of order: he bringeth all to his chiefly intended end; all doe make for his glory.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In this divine ordination, three things doe concurre: <hi>conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutio finis, mediorum ad finem diſpoſitio,</hi> and <hi>dispoſitorum directio.</hi> Firſt God <hi>appointeth an end</hi> to every thing. Secondly hee <hi>diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the meanes</hi> vnto the end. Thirdly he <hi>directeth the meanes</hi> ſo diſpoſed. From theſe points thus ſummarily rehearſed, I inferre my propounded doctrine:
<q>No calamity, or miſerie befalleth any one of whatſoever eſtate, or degree by chance, or at adventure.</q>
            </p>
            <p>For if it be true (as true it is, and the gates of Hell ſhall never be able to prevaile againſt it,) that God by his wonderful pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence <hi>maintaineth,</hi> and <hi>preſerueth; ruleth,</hi> and <hi>gouerneth; or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth, dispoſeth,</hi> and <hi>directeth</hi> all things in this world, even to the very haires of our heads; it cannot be, that <hi>any calamity,</hi> or <hi>miſery</hi> ſhould befal any one of vs by <hi>adve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture,</hi> by <hi>hap-hazzard,</hi> by <hi>chance,</hi> by <hi>fortune.</hi>

            <p>For the truth of your antecedent, we ſtand on your ſide.

            <p>That the <hi>hand</hi> of God betokeneth ſometime his <hi>loue,</hi> &amp; the benefits redounding thence to man, mans being, and his well-being, may eaſily be proved. In the ſecond chapter of the book of <hi>Iudges,</hi> ver. 15. we read that <hi>the Lords</hi> hand <hi>was againſt the</hi> Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites <hi>for evill:</hi> the collection thence may be, that <hi>the Lords</hi> hand <hi>is ſometime toward ſome for good.</hi> It's made plaine out of <hi>Nehem.</hi> 2.8. where the Prophet, to ſhew how ready <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> was to do him pleaſure, ſaith; <hi>the king gaue me according to the good</hi> hand <hi>of my God vpon me.</hi> I might by many like inſtances out of holy Scripture giue ſtrength to this poſition; but it may ſeeme to be a needleſſe labour. Therefore I proceed.</p>
            <p>Now that <hi>the</hi> hand <hi>of God</hi> ſhould betoken his <hi>displeaſure,</hi> &amp; the effects thereof, may be proved as eaſily. When the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> forſaking God betooke themſelues to ſerue <hi>Baalim,</hi> the <hi>hand of the</hi> LORD <hi>was ſore againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> Iudg. 2.15. the Lords <hi>ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d;</hi> that is, his iudgement, puniſhment, and revengement was ſore vpon them: the wrath of the LORD was hote againſt them: he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered them into the the hands of the ſpoilers: they were ſpoiled ſold to their enemies, and ſore puniſhed.</p>
            <p>When the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> had brought the <hi>arke of God</hi> into the houſe of <hi>Dagon,</hi> the <hi>hand of the</hi> LORD <hi>was heavy vpon them,</hi> 1.

               <hi>The</hi> LORD <hi>awaked as one out of ſleepe, and like a gyant refreſhed with wine, he ſmote his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies with Emerods, and put them to a perpetuall ſhame.</hi> Of like ſignification is the phraſe in my text: <hi>I will turne my</hi> hand <hi>to</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kron: my <hi>hand</hi> ſhall be ſore againſt <hi>Ekron;</hi> I will come againſt

               <hi>Ekron</hi> in Iudgement; I will puniſh <hi>Ekron,</hi> I will take vengeance on <hi>Ekron.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I will turne my hand]</hi> Sometime this phraſe betokeneth the good grace, and favour of God, as Zach. 13.7. <hi>I will turne my</hi> hand <hi>vpon my little ones.</hi> My little ones, (when the ſhephearde ſhall be ſmitten, and the ſheepe ſcattered,) I will recover with my <hi>hand,</hi> and preſerue them for ever: I will gather them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I will comfort them, I wil defend them: <hi>rurſus ad paſtorem, et praeceptorem ſuum reducam,</hi> ſaith <hi>Ribera:</hi> though they be ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, I will bring them backe againe to their owne ſhepheard, and maſter. There, you ſee, Gods <hi>turning of his hand</hi> vpon his little ones, is <hi>for good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here it's otherwiſe. God turneth <hi>his hand</hi> to <hi>Ekron</hi> for evill. This is averred and iuſtified by the infallible predictions of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prophets. <hi>Zachary,</hi> chap. 9.5. foretelleth, that <hi>much ſorrow ſhall betide</hi> Ekron. <hi>Zephani,</hi> chap. 2.4. ſaith, that Ekron <hi>ſhall bee rooted vp.</hi> Ieremy, chap. 25.20. takes the <hi>cup of the wine of Gods indignation, and giues it</hi> Ekron <hi>to drinke,</hi> to make <hi>Ekron</hi> like her neighbour countries, even <hi>deſolate,</hi> an <hi>aſtoniſhment, a h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Ekron]</hi> Will you know what this <hi>Ekron</hi> was? You ſhall find in the booke of <hi>Ioſhua,</hi> chap. 13.3. that it was a <hi>dukedome</hi> in the land of the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> and 1. Sam. 6.16. that there was in this dukedome, a <hi>city</hi> of the ſame name; no <hi>baſe city,</hi> but a <hi>princes ſeate;</hi> able at one time to giue entertainement to fiue princes.

            <q>There is no ſafe being in city, or country from the hand of God, when he is diſpoſed to puniſh.</q>
            <p>The reaſon is: becauſe there is no place to fly vnto from his preſence: None.

            <p>Is it true? Is there <hi>no ſafe being in city, or country, from the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of God, when he is diſpoſed to puniſh?</hi> One vſe hereof is, to teach vs to take patiently whatſoever <hi>afflictions</hi> ſhall befall vs. <hi>Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> I cal, whatſoever is any way oppoſite to humane nature; ſuch as are the temptations of the fleſh, the world, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill: the diſeaſes of the body, an infortunate husband, or wife, rebellious children, vnthankfull friends, loſſe of goods, reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, ſclanders, warre, peſtilence, famine, impriſonment, death, every croſſe, &amp; paſſion, bodily, or ghoſtly, proper to our ſelues, or appertaining to ſuch as are of our bloud, private or publike, ſecret or manifeſt, either by our owne deſerts gotten, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe impoſed vpon vs.</p>
            <p>All, and every of theſe, <hi>true Chriſtians</hi> will patiently vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe. For they with their ſharp ſighted eie of faith, doe clearelie ſee the <hi>Hand</hi> of God in every of their <hi>moleſtations:</hi> and in great contentment they take vp the words of patient <hi>Iob,</hi> chap. 2.10. <hi>Shall we receiue good at the hand of God, and not receiue evill?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here let every <hi>afflicted</hi> ſoule examine it ſelfe, how it is affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with the <hi>affliction,</hi> vnder which i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> groaneth. If you eſteem of your <hi>afflictions,</hi> as of God his fatherly <hi>chaſtiſements,</hi> and ſo endure them, bleſſed are yee: Of this bleſſednes <hi>S.

            </p>
            <p>Againe; is it true? Is <hi>there no ſafe being in citie, or country, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the hand of God, when he is diſpoſed to puniſh?</hi> A ſecond vſe of this doctrine is, to admoniſh vs, that we labour aboue al things to obtaine Gods favour, and to abide in it: ſo ſhall we bee ſafe from the feare of evill.</p>
            <p>Now for the obtaining of Gods favour, wee muſt doe foure things. We muſt 1. Humble our ſelues before God; 2. Beleeue in Chriſt; 3. Repent of our ſinnes; 4. Performe new obedience vnto God.</p>
            <pb n="161" facs="tcp:1729:85"/>
            <p>The time will not ſuffer me to enlarge theſe points. Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, faith in Chriſt, repentance, and a new life; theſe foure wil be vnto you, as <hi>Iacobs</hi> ladder was vnto the Angels. Of that lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you may read, Gen. 28.12. that it <hi>ſtood vpon the earth; the top of it did reach to heaven,</hi> and the <hi>Angels of God went vp it.</hi> So may you, by theſe foure, <hi>Humiliation, faith, repentance,</hi> and <hi>newneſſe of life,</hi> as it were by ſo many ſteps, and rounds of a lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, clime vp to heaven.</p>
            <p>Here you haue no continuing citie; you are but ſtrangers, &amp; pilgrims on the earth; your countrey is aboue, the Celeſtiall <hi>Ieruſalem:</hi> there let your hearts be. As for the afflictions, vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, tribulations, miſeries, and croſſes, wherewith this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall life of your is ſeaſoned, let them be your ioy. They are ſure pledges of Gods loue vnto you. Even ſo ſaith the Spirit, Hebr. 12.6. <hi>Whom the</hi> LORD <hi>loueth, he chaſtneth, and he ſcourgeth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſonne, that he receiueth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly is it true? Is there <hi>no ſafe being in city, or country from the hand of God, when he is diſpoſed to puniſh?</hi> A third vſe of this doctrine is, for the terrour of ſuch, as lie wallowing in the fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe of their ſinnes.

            <p>God is of pure eies, and beholdeth not iniquity: He hath
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:1729:89"/> laid righteouſnes to the rule, and weighed his iuſtice in a bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance. The ſentence is paſſed forth, &amp; muſt ſtand vncontroule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, even as long as ſun and moone: Tribulation and anguiſh vpon every ſoule that doth evil. The ſoule that ſinneth, it ſhalbe puniſhed. God makes it good by an oath, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.41. That he will whet his glitering ſword, and his hand ſhall take holde on iudgement to execute vengeance for ſin. His ſoule hateth and abhorreth ſin; his law curſeth and condemneth ſin; his hande ſmiteth and ſcourgeth ſin. Sin was his motiue to caſt down an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels into Hell; to thruſt <hi>Adam</hi> out of Paradiſe; to turne cities into aſhes; to ruinate nations; to torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t his own bowels in the ſimilitude of ſinfull fleſh. Becauſe of ſinne hee drowned the old world, and becauſe of ſinne ere long will burne this. Thus doe <hi>many ſinnes plucke downe from Heauen the moſt certaine wrath, and vengeance of God vpon the ſinners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One vſe of this doctrine was; to teach vs heedfulneſſe in all our waies, that wee doe not by our many ſinnes provoke Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God to high diſpleaſure.</p>
            <p>A ſecond vſe was; to moue vs to a ſerious contemplation of the wonderfull patience of Almightie God, who did ſo graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly forbeare theſe <hi>Tyrians,</hi> till by <hi>three</hi> and <hi>foure tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> by their many ſinnes, they had provoked him to indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Theſe things I haue heretofore laboured to lay vnto your hearts.</p>
            <p>Now followeth the third part of this prophecie, wherein you haue the declaration of that grievous ſinne, by which the <hi>Tyrians</hi> ſo highly offended: the ſinne of <hi>vnmercifulneſſe,</hi> and <hi>cruelty;</hi> expreſſed in two branches.</p>
            <list>

            <p n="1">1 <hi>They ſhut vp the whole captivitie in</hi> Edom] The expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of theſe wordes I haue formerly delivered vnto you in my <hi>twelfth lecture,</hi> &amp; my meditations vpon the 6. <hi>verſe.</hi> There the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> are condemned for <hi>carrying away priſoners the whole captivitie, to ſhut them vp in</hi> Edom: and here are the <hi>Tyrians</hi> condemned, for <hi>ſhutting the whole captivitie in</hi> Edom. The ſin
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:1729:90"/> ſeemeth to be the ſame in both; the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> and the <hi>Tyrians.</hi> Both did <hi>ſhut vp the whole captivitie in</hi> Edom; that is, as <hi>Ioel</hi> chap. 3.6. ſpeaketh; they both did ſell away <hi>the children of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah, and the children of Ieruſalem vnto the Grecians, that they might ſend them farre from their borders.</hi> God his peculiar inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, his owne ſeed, and ſervants, the <hi>children of Iudah,</hi> and <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> were by the cruell, and hard-hearted <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> and <hi>Tyrians,</hi> mancipated, and ſold away for bondſlaues to the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,</hi> dwelling farre of, that with them they might liue in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall ſervitude, and ſlaverie, without all hope of libertie, or redemption.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arias Montanus</hi> noteth a difference betwixt that ſinne of the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> and this of the <hi>Tyrians.</hi> The Philiſtines <hi>carried away priſoners the whole captivitie, to ſhut them vp in</hi> Edom. They did, as they thought, but what they might doe lawfully, by the law of nations. The <hi>Iewes</hi> were their <hi>captiues,</hi> and <hi>priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> conquered by a ſtrong hand in <hi>open hoſtilitie,</hi> and for this reſpect they <hi>ſhut them vp in</hi> Edom; they ſold them to the <hi>Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> to be by them tranſported to the <hi>Idumaeans.</hi> But theſe <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> had no ſuch prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſe of excuſe. They did not with a ſtrong hand, in <hi>open hoſtilitie,</hi> conquer the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and ſo <hi>take them pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners,</hi> but did <hi>ſurpriſe</hi> them by <hi>deceit,</hi> and <hi>treacherie,</hi> as they lay at <hi>Tyrus</hi> for <hi>trafficke,</hi> and <hi>entercourſe of marchandiſe,</hi> &amp; thus ſurpriſed they <hi>ſhut them vp in</hi> Edom; they ſold them to the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,</hi> to bee by them tranſported to the <hi>Idumaeans,</hi> farre from their owne country, even to <hi>Italie.</hi> For it is a conſtant tradition in all <hi>Hebrew</hi> hiſtories, that a great part of the <hi>Italian</hi> nation, ſpecially thoſe that dwelt at <hi>Rome,</hi> had their beginning from the <hi>Idumaeans.</hi> But I will not proſecute this opinion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They ſhut the whole captivitie in</hi> Edom] They ſpared not, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>women,</hi> or <hi>children,</hi> or the <hi>aged;</hi> they tooke no pitie, no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, vpon either <hi>ſexe,</hi> or <hi>age;</hi> but <hi>all</hi> of <hi>all</hi> ſorts, <hi>male</hi> and <hi>fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, young</hi> and <hi>old,</hi> a <hi>whole and perfect captivitie,</hi> they delivered vp into the hands of the <hi>Edomites.</hi> The <hi>Edomites</hi> were the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity of <hi>Eſau,</hi> who was named <hi>Edom,</hi> as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were the poſterity of <hi>Iacob,</hi> who was named <hi>Iſrael. Eſau</hi> purſued <hi>Iacob</hi>
               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:1729:90"/> with a deadly hate: ſo did the poſteritie of <hi>Eſau,</hi> the poſteritie of <hi>Iacob.</hi> The <hi>Edomites</hi> were evermore moſt maliciouſly bent againſt the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now behold the foulneſſe of this ſinne, wherewith the <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> are here charged. It was the ſin of <hi>crueltie</hi> in a very high degree. It is a <hi>cruel deed</hi> to detaine any one vnlawfully from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning into his natiue country: but him that is ſo detained, to ſell away for a <hi>bondſlaue</hi> to his <hi>mortalleſt enimie,</hi> this a <hi>crueltie,</hi> then which there cannot be a greater. Such was the ſinne of theſe <hi>Tyrians. They ſold the Iewes, Iacobs poſteritie,</hi> and God his ſervants, to their <hi>profeſſed enimies,</hi> the <hi>Edomites,</hi> with this poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, that being carried farre fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their owne country, they might liue in eternall <hi>ſlaverie,</hi> and <hi>bondage,</hi> without hope ever to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne home againe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They ſhut the whole captivitie in</hi> Edom] The <hi>Tyrians</hi> are here diſproued, for delivering vp <hi>Gods inheritance,</hi> a beleeuing na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, into the hands of profane <hi>Edomites.</hi> And it may remember you of a leſſon, heretofore commended to your Chriſtian con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is not lawfull to commit the children of beleeuers into the hands of infidels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The reaſon is, that they bee not withdrawne from their holy <hi>faith,</hi> religious <hi>worſhip,</hi> and <hi>ſervice</hi> of God.</p>
            <p n="1">1 This doctrine ſerueth for our inſtruction. It teacheth vs, ſo to loue the ſoules of the righteous ſeed, that wee leaue them not reſident, among infidels, Atheiſts, Papiſts, or other profane wretches, but rather that to our owne coſt, and labour, wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme them out of the Divels tyrannie.</p>

            <p n="3">3 Sith it is not lawfull to commit the children of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers into the hands of infidels, for the reaſon aboue ſpecified, that they bee not withdrawne from their holy faith, religious

            </p>
            <p>Let no man ſay vnto me, ſuch a mans <hi>ſervant,</hi> and ſuch a mans, are employed in <hi>temporall affaires</hi> at the time of <hi>divine ſervice,</hi> and why ſhould not mine be likewiſe?

            <p>Now followeth the ſecond branch expreſſing the ſin of the <hi>Tyrians,</hi> their ſinne of <hi>vnmercifulneſſe,</hi> and <hi>crueltie.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>They haue not remembred the covenant of brethren.</q>

            <p>
               <hi>The covenant of brethren</hi> here mentioned, ſome doe referre to that league of amitie, which was concluded betweene King <hi>Solomon,</hi> &amp; <hi>Hiram,</hi> King of <hi>Tyre,</hi> recorded, 1.

Some doe properly vnderſtand theſe words, to ſignifie that naturall league, which ſhould haue beene betweene <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> naturall brethren, and their poſteritie in lineall deſcent, the <hi>Iewes, Iſraelites,</hi> and <hi>Edomites.</hi> Vnderſtand it which way you will: the <hi>Tyrians</hi> were both wayes blameable. Firſt they <hi>remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred not the covenant,</hi> made betweene their King, K. <hi>Hiram,</hi> &amp; King <hi>Solomon.</hi> Secondly they <hi>remembred not the couenant,</hi> made by nature betweene the <hi>Iewes, Iſraelites,</hi> and <hi>Edomites,</hi> breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren lineally deſcended from two naturall brethren, <hi>Iacob,</hi> and <hi>Eſau.</hi> From both expoſitions ariſeth profitable doctrine.</p>

Peter, and the Apoſtles, Act. 5.29. doe put you in mind, that it is better to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey God, then men. And God in his holy word co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeth you to <hi>be ſubiect to the higher powers,</hi> as you haue already heard, Ro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 13.1. <hi>to honour the King,</hi> 1. Pet. 2.17. <hi>to ſubmit your ſelues to all manner ordinance of man for his ſake, whether it be vnto the King as vnto the ſuperiour, or vnto other governours, verſe.</hi> 13. You haue taken your <hi>oath of allegiance,</hi> and ſworne obedience to your King; breake not this your <hi>covenant</hi> with him, that Gods wrath break not forth in fire againſt you, as it did againſt theſe <hi>Tyrians,</hi> for not <hi>remembring the covenant of brethren.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus farre by occaſion of the firſt expoſition of theſe words <hi>They remembred not the covenant of brethren,</hi> that is, they <hi>reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred not the covenant,</hi> made betweene their King, K. <hi>Hiram,</hi> and the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> King <hi>Solomon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now ſomewhat of the other expoſition. <hi>They remembred not the covenant of brethren;</hi> that is, <hi>they remembred not the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> made by nature betweene the <hi>Iewes, Iſraelites,</hi> and <hi>Edo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites,</hi> brethren lineally deſcended from two naturall brethren, <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau.</hi> They knewe full well, that the <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> were the iſſue of <hi>Iacob,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Edomites</hi> of <hi>Eſau;</hi> they knew likewiſe, that the <hi>Edomites</hi> bore a mortall hatred towards the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and <hi>Iſraelites;</hi> yet ſold they the <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> vnto the <hi>Edomites;</hi> and are therefore here ſaid <hi>not to remember the brotherly covenant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The man that conſpireth miſchiefe, and deſtruction to his <hi>brother,</hi> is a monſter in nature, worthy to be purſued with eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall deteſtation: and whoſoever abhorreth not from conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to ſuch a wickedneſſe, but giueth furtherance, or counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:1729:93"/> thereto, he is holden in the ſame impietie. The <hi>Edomites</hi> ſought the deſtruction of the <hi>Iewes</hi> &amp; <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Tyrians</hi> did further them in their bloody deſignes; the <hi>Tyrians</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are partakers with the <hi>Edomites</hi> in the ſinne of <hi>vnmerciful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi> Which ſinne is here laid vnto their charge in theſe words, <hi>They remembred not the brotherly covenant.</hi> Hence we may take this leſſon,
<q>It is a thing very diſtaſtful, and vnpleaſing vnto God, either for brethren to be at variance among themſelues, or for others to countenance them in their quarrels.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Our aſſent to this truth, the light of nature within vs, doth extort from vs. Of the firſt part of my propoſition, wherein I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vow it, <hi>to be a very diſtaſtfull thing vnto God for brethren to bee at variance among themſelues,</hi> I ſhall haue fit opportunitie to entreat, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I ſhal come to the 11. verſe of this chapter, where <hi>Edom</hi> is reproued for <hi>purſuing his brother with the ſword.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of the other part, wherein I doe affirme it, to <hi>be an vpleaſing thing to God for any to countenance brethren in their quarrels,</hi> I will by Gods aſſiſtance, ſpeake at this time very briefly.</p>
            <q>It is a thing very diſtaſtfull and vnpleaſant vnto God, for any to countenance brethren, in their quarrels.</q>
            <p>The adviſe is good which S. <hi>Paule</hi> giueth, Epheſ. 5.11. <hi>Haue yee no fellowſhip with the vnfruitfull workes of darkneſſe, but eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reproue them rather.</hi> What are the <hi>workes of darkneſſe,</hi> but <hi>the workes of the fleſh?</hi> Now in Galat. 5.19. in the Catalogue of the <hi>workes of the fleſh,</hi> we find <hi>hatred, debate, wrath, contention.</hi> With theſe therefore we muſt haue no <hi>fellowſhip,</hi> we muſt <hi>reproue</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> rather.</p>
            <p>Muſt we haue no fellowſhip with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? Muſt we <hi>reproue</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> rather? What ſaith <hi>old Adam?</hi> What ſaith <hi>fleſh</hi> and <hi>blood</hi> to this? Our <hi>Gallants</hi> of this age can entertaine no ſuch adviſe: that it may be fulfilled, which our Saviour <hi>Chriſt</hi> foretold of the ende of the world, Luk. 21.10. &amp; 16. <hi>Nation ſhall riſe againſt nation, kingdome againſt kingdome, a father againſt his ſonne, a brother againſt his brother, a kinſman againſt his kinſman, and a friend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his friend.</hi>

            <p>A fitter remedie for this maladie I find none, then to imitate bleſſed <hi>Abraham.</hi> There grew a debate betweene his ſervants, and the ſervants of <hi>Lot;</hi> their heardmen could not agree. What doth <hi>Abraham</hi> in this caſe? As the manner of <hi>Maſters</hi> is now adaies? No; he breaketh not out into <hi>choler;</hi> he ſaith not: <hi>my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants are abuſed; my coſin</hi> LOT <hi>his ſervants doe ſeeke to crow o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them, and to rule the roſt, as they liſt. This is an iniurie to mee their maſter, and a ſhame to ſuffer it. So a man may be made a foole indeed, and counted a wretch, and a daſtard of no reputation. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver will any man care to ſerue me, if I ſticke not better to my men, then ſo.</hi> Such language, as the world now goeth, is very rife a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong vs.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Abraham</hi> ſpake not ſo. Grace was in his face, &amp; mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in his words. For thus ſpake he vnto his nephew <hi>Lot<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Gen. 13.8. <hi>I pray thee, let there be no ſtrife betweene thee, and me; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hetweene thy heardmen and my heardmen; for we are brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> We are <hi>brethren;</hi> I pray let there be no <hi>ſtrife</hi> between vs. Let vs be mindfull of the <hi>covenant,</hi> wherein nature hath vnited our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; we are <hi>brethren:</hi> the bond of <hi>brotherhood</hi> and <hi>conſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinitie,</hi> let it moderate our paſſions: why ſhall we iarre, and be at odds betweene our ſelues? Are we not <hi>brethren?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An excellent patterne of imitation, for all eſtates, high and low; rich, &amp; poore; one with another. Noblemen, Gentlemen, Yeomen; all, whoſoever may ſay they are <hi>brethren,</hi> either in <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> or in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>religion,</hi> haue in <hi>Abraham</hi> a patterne for their imitation. We muſt abſtaine, not only from raiſing <hi>ſtrife,</hi> and <hi>debate</hi> our ſelues, but alſo from foſtering and cheriſhing it in others. Such was <hi>Abrahams</hi> choice. Hee would not main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine his <hi>ſervants</hi> againſt <hi>Lots ſervants:</hi> hee tooke it to be farre more credit for him to haue <hi>vnitie,</hi> and <hi>good loue,</hi> then the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter effects of the contrarie.</p>
            <p>Among the beatitudes Matth. 5. the ſeaventh is; <hi>Bleſſed are the peacemakers.</hi> Bleſſed are they, who loue <hi>concord,</hi> regard <hi>peace,</hi> ſeeke it, and inſue after it. Bleſſed are they who beſtirre the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to cheriſh, &amp; maintaine <hi>peace,</hi> and <hi>concord</hi> betweene others.

Bleſſed are the peacemakers:</hi> the reaſon is annexed; <hi>for they ſhall be called the children of God,</hi> that is, they will by their loue of <hi>vnitie,</hi> and <hi>concord,</hi> make it appeare vnto the world, that they are the ſonnes of God.</p>
            <p>From whence it followeth by an argument from the place of <hi>contraries: Accurſed are makebates,</hi> for they ſhall be called the children of the Divell. Curſed are they, who are of themſelues <hi>quarrelſome,</hi> and <hi>contentious.</hi> Curſed are they, who beſtirre the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to cheriſh, and maintaine <hi>ſtrife,</hi> &amp; <hi>debate</hi> in others.

            <p>Now (dearely beloued in the LORD) I beſeech you to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue farre from you all cogitation, and thought of <hi>ſtrife, vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,</hi> and <hi>debate;</hi> &amp; to remember your <hi>brotherly covenant.</hi> Know yee, that the bond of <hi>one</hi> body, <hi>one</hi> ſpirit, <hi>one</hi> hope, <hi>one</hi> God, <hi>one</hi> faith, <hi>one</hi> baptiſme, is as farre aboue the bond of <hi>one</hi> father, <hi>one</hi> mother, <hi>one</hi> village, <hi>one</hi> houſe, and the like, as the <hi>spirit</hi> is aboue the <hi>fleſh,</hi> ſpirituall things, aboue carnall, and God aboue man.</p>
            <p>I will ſhut vp this point, with the exhortation of <hi>S. Peter,</hi> 1. <hi>ep. chap.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Be yee all of one minde; one ſuffer with another; loue as brethren; be pitifull; be courteous; render not evill for evill, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke for rebuke: but contrarywiſe bleſſe yee;</hi> bleſſe I ſay, and <hi>knowe that you are therevnto called, that yee ſhould be heires of bleſſing.</hi> Thus farre of the thirde part of this Prophecie. Now followeth the fourth.</p>

                  <hi>Verſ. 10.</hi>
               </bibl> Therefore will I ſend a fire vpon the wals of <hi>Tyrus,</hi> &amp; and it ſhall devoure the palaces thereof.</q>
            <p>This is a particular denunciation of a conqueſt, and deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt the city <hi>Tyrus,</hi> for her ſins. According to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction it came to paſſe ſaith <hi>Druſius,</hi> either in the warre of <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manaſſar</hi> againſt the <hi>Tyrians,</hi> or in the warre of <hi>Nabuchodono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor.</hi> Yet this he affirmeth not. <hi>Nabuchodonoſor</hi> beſieged <hi>Tyrus</hi>
               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:1729:95"/> three yeares and three moneths, &amp; then tooke it: ſo ſaith <hi>Winc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kleman</hi> out of <hi>Ioſephus, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>contra Appionem:</hi> the Latine co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies of <hi>Ioſephus,</hi> which I haue ſeene, make mention of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of this ſiege for <hi>thirteene yeares.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Greeke copy hath nothing of the continuance of it. For therein I read only; that when <hi>Thobalus</hi> was king, <hi>Nabuchodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſor</hi> beſieged <hi>Tyrus.</hi> This was about the yeare of the world, 3345. <hi>Tyrus</hi> after this was reedified, and did flouriſh. But ſhee was in her pride againe beſieged, and taken by <hi>Alexander the great</hi> in the yeare of the world, 3632. And lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g ſince, A.C. 1290 ſhe was ſacked, and levelled with the ground, by <hi>Alphix</hi> then <hi>Sultan</hi> of <hi>Egypt.</hi> Thus hath Gods hand beene ſtrong &amp; prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling againſt <hi>Tyrus,</hi> according to the tenour of this prophecie. The very words whereof, you haue heard before expounded, in the <hi>fourth,</hi> and <hi>ſeaventh verſes</hi> of this <hi>chapter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I pray you only recount with me ſuch heads of doctrine as heretofore haue beene obſerved out of theſe words: <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will I ſend a fire, &amp;c.</hi> Wherein three circumſtances are to be obſerved. 1. The puniſher. 2. The puniſhment. 3. The pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed.</p>
            <p>The firſt circumſtance is the puniſher, the LORD: For thus ſaith the LORD, <hi>I will ſend]</hi> The doctrine is,
<q>It is proper to the Lord to execute vengeance vpon the wicked for their ſins.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond circumſtance is the puniſhment, and that is by <hi>fire: I will ſend a fire]</hi> The doctrine is,
<q>The fire, and all other creatures are at the Lordes commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to be employed by him in the puniſhment of the wicked.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The third circumſtance is the puniſhed, <hi>the wals</hi> and <hi>palaces of</hi> Tyrus: <hi>I will ſend a fire vpon the wals of</hi> Tyrus, <hi>and it ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voure the palaces thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, muſt the glorious city <hi>Tyrus</hi> be deſtroied? The doctrine is: <hi>No munition can ſaue that city, which God will haue deſtroyed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, muſt the <hi>Wals</hi> of <hi>Tyrus</hi> bee devoured with the fire of Gods diſpleaſure? The doctrine is,
<q>It is the good bleſſing of God vpon a kingdome, to haue wals,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:1729:95"/> ſtrong holds, munitions, fortreſſes, and bullwarkes for a defenſe againſt enimies.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, muſt the <hi>palaces</hi> of <hi>Tyrus</hi> be conſumed with the fire of Gods anger? The doctrine is,
<q>God depriveth vs of a great bleſſing when he taketh from vs our dwelling houſes.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Of theſe doctrines, and their ſeverall vſes, I haue hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this place at large entreated. Wherefore let this which hath beene now ſpoken, ſuffice for my preſent expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this prophecie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Tyrus.</hi>

            <p>The purſued is <hi>Edoms</hi> brother, <hi>Iacob,</hi> ſurnamed <hi>Iſrael,</hi> &amp; his poſterity, the <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Iſraelites.</hi>

<pb n="184" facs="tcp:1729:97"/> thought <hi>Eſau</hi> in his mind, Gen. 27.41. <hi>The daies of mourning for my father will come ſhortly, then will I ſlay my brother</hi> Iacob. <hi>Iacob</hi> to aſſwage his brother <hi>Eſau's</hi> fiercenes, fled<note n="b" place="margin">Gen. 27.44.</note> to his vncle <hi>Laban</hi> in <hi>Meſopotamia,</hi> with whom hee lived<note n="c" place="margin">Gen. 31.38.</note>

            <p>This inexpiable rancour, and hatred, ended not in <hi>Eſau.</hi> His malicious poſteritie retained it. Witneſſe the churliſh an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere given to <hi>Moſes</hi> his ambaſſadours, Num. 20.20. <hi>Moſes</hi> being to conduct the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> from <hi>Egypt</hi> to the promiſed land, deſirous to bring them the neereſt way, ſent to the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Edom</hi> for leaue to paſſe through his country: <hi>I pray thee let vs paſſe through thy country: we will not goe through the fields, nor through the vineyards; we will not drinke of the water of thy wells; we will goe by the Kings high way: wee will not turne to the right hand, nor to the left, vntill we be paſt thy borders: we will goe the high way. If I and my cattle drinke of thy water, I will then pay for it: I will only, without any harme goe thorow on my feet. Moſes</hi> the meekeſt man vpon the earth, thus meekely beſought the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Edom</hi> for paſſage thorow his country. Could hee obtaine it, thinke you? No. The inveterate <hi>hatred,</hi> wherewith <hi>Eſau</hi> was poſſeſſed, reſiding in his poſteritie, cauſed a deniall to ſo honeſt a petition.

<q>It is a thing very diſtaſtfull, and vnpleaſing vnto God for bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren to be at variance among themſelues.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Our aſſent to this truth the light of nature within vs, doth extort fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs. By natures light the very Heathen haue acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged <hi>one</hi> God, &amp; him the author of vnitie, and friendſhip; as <hi>Plato</hi> in his <hi>Lyſis.</hi> From the ſame parents, <hi>one</hi> father, &amp; <hi>one</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as from <hi>one</hi> ſeed, <hi>one</hi> roote, <hi>one</hi> beginning, by natures ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance doe ſpring<note n="g" place="margin">Plutarch. de amore fraterno.</note> 
               <hi>two, three,</hi> or <hi>more brethren,</hi> not for diſcord, or contrarietie; but that being many, they might the better, one helpe another.</p>
            <p>That <hi>brother</hi> that <hi>warreth</hi> with his <hi>brother,</hi> in <hi>Plutarch</hi> his iudgement, doth voluntarily<note n="h" place="margin">Ibid.</note> cut of a member of his own fleſh.

            <p>When <hi>Socrates</hi> ſaw <hi>Chaerephon,</hi> and <hi>Chaerecrates,</hi> two bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren iarring and warring each with other, hee ſaid vnto them: you doe now, as if the <hi>hands,</hi> which were created to helpe one the other, ſhould hinder, and hurt one the other: or as the <hi>feete,</hi> which were framed to beare one anothers burthen, ſhould ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant one the other: or as the <hi>eares,</hi> which are coauditors of mutuall good, ſhould wax deafe to heare good one for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: or as the <hi>eyes,</hi> which like <hi>Caleb,</hi> and <hi>Ioſhua,</hi> are fellow ſpies in this <hi>Microcoſme,</hi> this little world, and land of men, for the good each of other, ſhould looke a ſquinte at the good each of other. You will grant it to bee very vnnaturall, either for the <hi>hands,</hi> or for the <hi>feet,</hi> or for the <hi>eares,</hi> or for the <hi>eyes,</hi> one to <hi>ſtriue</hi> againſt the other. Much more monſtrous will the <hi>ſtrife</hi> betweene brethren be; becauſe the aid, which one of them may and ſhould giue vnto the other, doth farre exceed the coope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the <hi>hands,</hi> the ſupportance of the <hi>feet,</hi> the coaudience of the <hi>eares,</hi> the providence of the <hi>eies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus farre haue I led you in <hi>Natures ſchoole.</hi> May it now
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:1729:98"/> pleaſe you to heare the ſame things out of <hi>the ſchoole of Grace?</hi> There <hi>Solomon</hi> hath this leſſon: <hi>Two are better then one; for if one of them fall, the other will lift him vp; But woe vnto him that is alone; for he falleth, and there is not a ſecond to lift him vp.</hi> The words are Eccleſ. 4.9, 10. The <hi>Hebrewes</hi> referre thoſe words to married couples: but <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeakes it generally: and thus you may expound it: <hi>Two are better then one,</hi> two brethren are better then one: <hi>for if one of them fall, the other will helpe him vp.</hi> If he <hi>fall</hi> into <hi>ſickneſſe,</hi> into <hi>want,</hi> into any kind of <hi>diſtreſſe, eri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get, &amp; allevabit eum frater,</hi> his brother will be a ſuccour to him. But woe to him that is alone. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, is an old ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>one man, is no man;</hi> woe to ſuch a man; <hi>woe to him that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone; for he falleth, and there is not a</hi> brother <hi>to lift him vp.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed <hi>one brother</hi> helping another <hi>is like a defenced city</hi> (as<note n="k" place="margin">Septuagint. Vulgat. Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron. Gloſſ. Lyran. Hugo Card.</note> ſome read it) and <hi>their counſails are like the barre of a palace, which is vnpregnable,</hi> Prov. 18.19. and if one overcome him, two ſhall ſtand againſt him, Eccleſ. 4.12. So naturall is their <hi>vnitie,</hi> and ſtrong their <hi>coadiuvance,</hi> which nature hath framed double for mutuall aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>The place cited out of the Prover. 18.19.<note n="l" place="margin">Mercer. Lavater. Bibl. Angl.</note> ſome read other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; <hi>A brother offended is harder to winne, then a ſtrong citie, &amp; their contentions are like the barres of a palace.</hi> And then the meaning is: The angers of brethren, one of them towards ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, are ſo ſharpe, and vehement, that they can no more eaſily be ſubdued, the ſtrong defenced townes conquered; nor more eaſily be broken, then moſt ſtrong barres. Which expoſition teacheth vs, that there is no <hi>ſtrife</hi> matcheable to the <hi>ſtrife amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g brethren.</hi> According to the proverbe: <hi>Fratrum contentiones a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerbiſſimae;</hi> moſt bitter are the contentions of brethren.</p>
            <p>Examples poeticall, hiſtoricall, &amp; Divine, do ſpeake as much. The implacable hatred of <hi>Atreus</hi> againſt <hi>Thyeſtes, Eteocles</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Polynices, Romulus</hi> againſt <hi>Remus, Baſſianus</hi> againſt <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta, Cain</hi> againſt <hi>Abel,</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> againſt <hi>Iacob,</hi> are they not as trumpets, to ſound out this truth? To this purpoſe might I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leage the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Argiers,</hi> the <hi>kingdome</hi> of <hi>Tunes,</hi> &amp; <hi>Ottomans familie,</hi> many a <hi>brothers hand</hi> embrued, and waſhed in his <hi>bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers blood;</hi> but ſeeing it is growne into a proverbe, <hi>Irae fratrum
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:1729:98"/> acerbiſſima;</hi> moſt bitter are the contentions of brethren, it nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth no further proofe.</p>
            <p>Againſt ſuch monſtrous, and prodigious contentions, the Holy Ghoſt would haue all Chriſtians well armed; and for this end giveth vs in holy writ many wholſome leſſons. Let a few ſerue this time. In the firſt Ep. of <hi>S. Ioh. chap.</hi> 2.11. we are taught that <hi>whoſoever hateth his brother, he is in darknes, he walketh in darknes, he knoweth not whether he goeth; darkneſſe hath blinded his eies:</hi> and chap. 3.15. that <hi>whoſoeuer hateth his brother, is a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſlayer:</hi> and chap. 4.20. that <hi>whoſoever hateth his brother is a lyer, if he ſaith he loveth God.</hi> The reaſon is annexed; <hi>For how can he, that loveth not his brother, whom he hath ſeene; loue God, whom he hath not ſeene?</hi> And this commaundement we haue of CHRIST, <hi>that he that loveth God, ſhould loue his brother alſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the booke of <hi>Proverbs,</hi> chap. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>6.19. we read of <hi>ſix</hi> things, which the LORD hateth, and of a <hi>ſeaventh,</hi> which his ſoule ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horreth: that <hi>ſeaventh</hi> is, verſe the 19. <hi>The man that raiſeth vp contentions among brethren.</hi> Now if God doe abhorre with his ſoule, the man that raiſeth vp contentions among brethren, how doth he like of the contentions themſelues? My pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded doctrine ſtands good,
<q>It is a thing very diſtaſtefull, and vnpleaſing vnto God, for bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren to be at variance among themſelues.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now let vs ſee, what vſes doe offer themſelues to our conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations out of this doctrine.</p>
            <p>Firſt it may ſerue for a iuſt reproofe of theſe our laſt, &amp; worſt daies, wherein by experience we finde true that ſame<note n="m" place="margin">D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. King B. of London vpon Ion. lect. 15.</note> para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxe, in common reaſon hardly to be proved, namely: that not <hi>friends</hi> only, or <hi>kinſmen,</hi> but <hi>brethren</hi> alſo, when they fall to <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,</hi> their <hi>hatred</hi> is greater, then that betwixt mortall foes. It is come to paſſe according to <hi>Chriſt</hi> his prophecie, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.36 <hi>A mans enimies ſhall be they of his owne houſe:</hi> A mans <hi>enimies</hi> indeed, and his <hi>enimies</hi> to purpoſe, to worke him moſt harme, <hi>ſhall be they of his owne houſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>May not many now a daies complaine, yea cry out, with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> Pſal. 55.12. <hi>If mine enimy had done me this diſhonour, I could haue borne it: if mine adverſarie had exalted himſelfe againſt me,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:1729:99"/> I would haue hid my ſelfe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him; but it was thou,</hi> O man, <hi>my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, my guide, my familiar:</hi> we <hi>tooke ſweet counſaile togither;</hi> we <hi>walked in the houſe of God, as friends.</hi> Yet haſt <hi>thou</hi> done me this diſhonor; yea, <hi>thou</hi> haſt exalted thy ſelfe againſt me.</p>
            <p>Of all the vials of the wrath of God powred down vpon ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, it is one of the ſoreſt, when a man is <hi>fed with his owne fleſh,</hi> and <hi>made drunke with his owne bloud, as with ſweet wine.</hi> So the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> ſpeaketh, chap. 49.26. The meaning is, as a chiefe<note n="n" place="margin">B King. Ibid.</note> pillar of our Church expoundeth it; when a man <hi>taketh plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in nothing more, then in the overthrow, and extirpation of his owne ſeed:</hi> when he thirſteth not <hi>for any bloud, but that which is drawne from the ſides of his brethren, and kinſmen.</hi> Never was there more eager and bitter contention betweene <hi>Turke</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> then now a daies there is betweene <hi>Chriſtian</hi> &amp; <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,</hi> a <hi>brother</hi> and a <hi>brother.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All we, who haue given our names to <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> and vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him ſervice in our baptiſme, we are all brethren, we are <hi>fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres vterini,</hi> brethren from the womb, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, we haue <hi>one father,</hi> and <hi>one mother;</hi> one father in heaven, and one mother; the <hi>holy Catholicke Church,</hi> militant vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the earth. But it fareth with vs, as it did with <hi>Simeon,</hi> and <hi>Levi,</hi> Gen. 49.5. <hi>We are brethren in evill; the inſtruments of cruelty are in our habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> They <hi>in their wrath ſlew a man:</hi> and what do we? If our <hi>wrath</hi> be kindled againſt <hi>our brother,</hi> we will not ſticke, <hi>Edom-like,</hi> to <hi>purſue him with the ſword;</hi> we will make our ſword to be fed with his fleſh, and drunke with his bloud.</p>
            <p>Thinke not (dearely beloved, you of the other <hi>ſex,</hi>) thinke not your ſelues exempt from this reproofe, becauſe in it I haue not made any mention of <hi>ſiſters;</hi> for vnder the name of <hi>brethren</hi> I meant you alſo. My ſpeach was vnto <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> &amp; in <hi>Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme</hi> diverſity of <hi>ſex</hi> maketh no difference. So ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, Gal. 3.28. <hi>Male, and female, all are one in Chriſt.</hi> To you therfore this reproofe of <hi>brethren at variance,</hi> doth alſo apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine. If <hi>you</hi> lay <hi>violent hands</hi> vpon any, <hi>your husbands, your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> or other; or if with <hi>your tongue,</hi> (which the holy Spirit, Pſ. 57.4. calleth <hi>a ſharpe ſword,</hi>) you are given to vexe them of <hi>your

<q>It is a thing very diſtaſtefull and vnpleaſing vnto God, for bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren to be at variance among themſelues.</q>
            </p>
            <p>A ſecond vſe is, to worke in vs <hi>brotherly kindneſſe:</hi> that ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, whereby every good Chriſtian embraceth the Church of God, and the members thereof, with the bowels of loue. This <hi>brotherly kindneſſe, S. Peter,</hi> 2. Ep. 1.7. commendeth vnto vs, as whereto we ought <hi>to giue all diligence.</hi>

            <p>Firſt, <hi>it is like that precious ointment,</hi> which was powred on the <hi>head</hi> of the high Prieſt, and <hi>ran downe vpon his beard,</hi> and ſo to the <hi>borders of his garments.</hi> Behold the ſweetnes and pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes of <hi>vnity.</hi> That ſweet <hi>perfume,</hi> &amp; <hi>ointment,</hi> that <hi>holy oile</hi> pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out vpon the high Prieſt, and his garment, was not only pleaſant and delightfull to himſelfe, but did alſo yeeld a ſweete ſmelling ſavour to all that were about him. So is it with <hi>vnitie.</hi> Is not only pleaſant to them, who doe religiouſly eſteeme and keepe it, but to others alſo, which are about them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it is like <hi>the dew of</hi> Hermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <hi>which fell vpon the mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of Sion; where the</hi> LORD <hi>appointed the bleſſing, and life for evermore.</hi> Behold the fruit, and profit, which commeth by <hi>Vnity.</hi> The <hi>dew,</hi> and wet, that fell downe from heaven vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> and <hi>Sion,</hi> made thoſe hils, and the plaine countries neere them, fertill: ſo doth <hi>Vnity</hi> bring with it great fruit, and profit. It makes them, among whom it is ſincerely obſerved, it makes them, through Gods bleſſing fruitfull, and plentifull in good workes towards God, and in him, and for him, towards men, &amp; one of them towards another. This <hi>vnity, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cord, brotherly loue, mutuall conſent</hi> and <hi>agreement,</hi> if it be vnfeigned, hath the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:1729:100"/> both of this life, and of that to come: of peace, and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in this life, and of eternall ioies in the life to come.</p>
            <p>One of the notes by which wee may bee aſſured of God his ſpeciall loue, and favour, is the <hi>loue of our brethren.</hi> Now that we deceiue not our ſelues in this loue, <hi>S. Iob.</hi> Epiſt. 1. giues vs three rules to direct vs.</p>
            <p n="1">1 <hi>Chriſtian brotherly loue</hi> muſt not be for any worldly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects or conſiderations, but principally for, and in God. Wee muſt <hi>loue our brethren</hi> principally, becauſe they are the ſons of God, and members of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> This rule he intimateth, chap. 5.1. <hi>Every one, that loveth him which begat, loveth him alſo which is begotten of him:</hi> that is, whoſoever loveth God the Father, hee loveth alſo the ſons of God; his naturall ſon <hi>Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> &amp; his ſons by grace and adoption, all Chriſtians,</p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> brotherly loue</hi> muſt not be outward in ſhew on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but inward in the heart. This rule he giveth vs, chap. 3.18. <hi>Let vs not loue in word, nor in tongue only, but indeed, &amp; in truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3 <hi>Chriſtian brotherly loue</hi> muſt be not only in time of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity, but when moſt need is. This rule he giveth, verſ. the 17<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Whoſoever hath this worlds good, and ſeeth his brother haue need, and ſhutteth vp his compaſſion from him, how dwelleth the loue of God in him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let theſe rules (beloved) be your direction. <hi>Loue</hi> yee everie one that is called a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> not becauſe he is rich, or in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, but becauſe he is a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> the ſon of God by grace, and adoption. <hi>Loue</hi> yee him, not outwardly in ſhew only, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, in heart, in deed, in truth. <hi>Loue</hi> him not only in his proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous and flouriſhing eſtate, but in his greateſt need; and be yee aſſured that the ſpeciall <hi>loue</hi> and <hi>favour of God,</hi> will be your <hi>ſhield,</hi> and <hi>protection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Three things there are, that do reioice God, ſaith <hi>Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> chap. 25.1. <hi>The vnity of brethren, the loue of neighbours, a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; his wife agreeing togither.</hi> The firſt, which is the <hi>vnity of bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> according to my former conſtruction, compriſeth the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two. All Chriſtians are <hi>brethren in Chriſt,</hi> a <hi>neighbour</hi> to a <hi>neighbour,</hi> a <hi>husband</hi> to his <hi>wife,</hi> a <hi>wife</hi> to her <hi>husband.</hi> For, as I
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:1729:100"/> ſaid, in <hi>Chriſt</hi> there is no differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of <hi>ſexe;</hi> there is neither <hi>male,</hi> nor <hi>female;</hi> all are <hi>brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in Chriſt;</hi> and therfore that <hi>neighbour,</hi> that loveth not his <hi>neighbour;</hi> the <hi>husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d,</hi> that is at ods with his <hi>wife;</hi> the <hi>wife,</hi> that agreeth not with her <hi>husband;</hi> they are guilty of the breach of <hi>brotherly loue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That exhortation made by <hi>S. Paule</hi> to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> cha. 12.10. concerneth all of you, all, of both <hi>ſexes,</hi> without any diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence: <hi>Be ye affectioned to loue one another with brotherly loue.</hi> I conclude this point with the ſame Apoſtles words, 1. Cor. 1.10 and 2. Cor. 13.11. <hi>Now I beſeech you brethren, by the name of our</hi> LORD <hi>Ieſus Chriſt, that yee speake all one thing, and that there bee no diſſentions among you: Be of one minde; liue in peace, and the God of peace ſhall be with you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus far of the firſt branch in the deſcription of <hi>Edoms</hi> ſin, and of the doctrine grounded therevpon: The doctrine was:
<q>It is a thing very diſtaſtefull, and vnpleaſing vnto God, for bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren to be at variance among themſelues.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It was grounded vpon theſe words, <hi>He did purſue his brother with the ſword.</hi> It followeth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And did caſt of all pity]</hi> or after the <hi>Hebrew</hi> text, <hi>did corrupt his compaſſions,</hi> which <hi>reading</hi> is expreſſed in the margin of our <hi>Church</hi> Bible, and the <hi>Geneva</hi> tranſlation. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſet out by <hi>Tyndall</hi> reads it otherwiſe: <hi>He deſtroyed his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wombe,</hi> and <hi>Winckleman</hi> reads it: <hi>&amp; violaverit vterum,</hi> and violated, or abuſed the mothers wombe: both do allude to the Greeke edition of the <hi>Septuagint</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>he did violate the mothers wombe;</hi> which <hi>reading</hi> may haue reference to the nativity of <hi>Iacob,</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> borne at one birth of their mother <hi>Rebekah.</hi> And then the meaning is, that the <hi>Edomites, Eſau's</hi> poſterity, neglecting that bond, &amp; knot of <hi>brotherhood,</hi> and <hi>conſanguinity,</hi> did exerciſe <hi>rigour,</hi> and <hi>cruelty</hi> againſt the <hi>Iſraelites, Iacobs</hi> poſterity: or it may haue reference to a ſavage and outragious <hi>cruelty,</hi> as if the <hi>Edomites</hi> were here noted for <hi>ripping vp mothers wombs,</hi> or <hi>women with childe, in Iſrael.</hi> That ſuch cruelty was vſed by the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> it is plaine by the 13. verſe of this chapter. But this text in the <hi>original,</hi> doth not faſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>I could bring you many places out of holy writ for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of this doctrine. But two only, or three, and they but touched, ſhall ſerue for this preſent. In Iob 6.14. the <hi>vnmerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi> are noted to <hi>haue forſaken the feare of the Almightie.</hi> In Rom. 1.31. among ſuch, as God hath giuen vp to a <hi>reprobate minde,</hi> to commit things worthy of death, the <hi>vnmercifull</hi> are named. In Iames, 2.13. a puniſhment is denounced to the <hi>vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifull; There ſhall be iudgement mercileſſe, to him, that ſheweth no mercy.</hi> Theſe few texts of Scripture doe plentifully eſtabliſh my doctrine.</p>

               <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nmercifulneſſe is a ſinne hatefull vnto God.</q>

               </gap>cture I began the expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the third part of this prophecie, which is a declaration of <hi>Edoms</hi> ſinnes in foure branches. The two firſt I paſſed over the laſt time. The firſt branch was; <hi>He did purſue his brother with the ſword.</hi> Thereon I grounded this doctrine,
<q>It is a thing very diſtaſtfull and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing vnto God, for brethren to bee at variance among themſelues.</q>
            </p>
            <p>One vſe of this doctrine was, a iuſt reproofe of the want of brotherly loue in theſe our daies.</p>
            <p>A ſecond vſe was an exhortation to brotherly kindneſſe.</p>
            <p>The ſecond branch was; <hi>He did caſt of all pitie.</hi> Thereon I grounded this doctrine,
<q>Vnmercifulneſſe is a ſinne hatefull vnto God.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The vſe I made of it, was to ſtirre vs vp to the exerciſes of humanitie, and mercie. Which meditation ended, I ended that Lecture. Now come I to the third branch in the declaration of <hi>Edoms</hi> ſinnes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>His anger ſpoiled him evermore]</hi> or, <hi>In his anger he ſpoiled him
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:1729:103"/> continually.</hi> The prepoſition is not expreſſed in the originall, but is wel vnderſtood, and ſupplied by ſome expoſitors, to this ſenſe: <hi>Edom,</hi> furious, and angry <hi>Edom,</hi> doth evermore <hi>vi apertâ,</hi> with open violence, attempt the ſpoile of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> and if open vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence prevaile not, <hi>intus ſimultatem alit;</hi> within him hee foſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth and cheriſheth privie and ſecret malice, ſuch as of old was harboured, and ſetled in old<note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 27 41.</note>

            </p>

The compariſon is: As a <hi>Lyon,</hi> a <hi>Wolfe,</hi> a <hi>Beare,</hi> or ſome other cruell <hi>beaſt,</hi> hunteth greedily after his prey, and when he hath gotten it, teareth it in pieces, and ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voureth it: ſo doth <hi>Edom;</hi> he hunteh for his brother, as with a ſnare, or net; and hauing once encloſed him, hee throwes him headlong into vtter deſolation: and this hee doth in the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his anger; <hi>In his anger he spoiled him evermore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This clauſe is otherwiſe rendred by the old Latin Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>&amp; tenuerit vltra furorem ſuum;</hi> Hee poſſeſſed his furie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond meaſure, longer then was meet he ſhould.

            <p>Both <hi>readings,</hi> this, and the former; this: <hi>He bore hatred very long,</hi> &amp; the former: <hi>In his anger he ſpoiled his brother evermore,</hi> both doe appeach, and accuſe <hi>Edom</hi> of raſh, vnadviſed, evill, &amp; ſinfull anger.

            </p>
            <p>If you demand a reaſon hereof, I muſt repeate vnto you God his holy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement: <hi>Thou ſhalt do no murther</hi> In the name of <hi>murther,</hi> are inhibited all the kindes of <hi>anger</hi> aboue ſpecified; the <hi>anger</hi> that lurketh in the <hi>heart,</hi> the <hi>anger</hi> that ſhineth in the <hi>countenance,</hi> the <hi>anger</hi> that is manifeſted in <hi>words;</hi> whereto I adde that <hi>anger</hi> that breaketh into <hi>action.</hi> If you <hi>wound,</hi> or but <hi>ſtrike</hi> your neighbour; if you <hi>speake bitterly</hi> againſt him; if you <hi>looke frowningly</hi> at him; if you <hi>hate</hi> him in heart, or be <hi>vnadvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly angry</hi> with him, you are before Almighty God <hi>guilty of murther.</hi> And for this cauſe, <hi>euery childe of God ought to keep him ſelfe vnspotted of anger.</hi>

            <p>Thus farre of the third branch in the deſcription of <hi>Edoms</hi> ſinne, and of the doctrine grounded therevpon. The doctrine was, <hi>Every child of God ought to keepe himſelfe vnspotted of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</hi> It was grounded vpon theſe words, <hi>His anger ſpoyled him evermore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And his wrath watched him alway]</hi> This is the <hi>Geneva</hi> tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation. <hi>His furie watcheth him evermore,</hi> ſo <hi>Tremellius.</hi> The meaning is, <hi>Edoms wrath,</hi> or <hi>furie,</hi> was ſo implacable, ſo farre from being abated, or aſſuaged, as that, it evermore watched <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to doe him a miſchiefe. In the <hi>Church Bible</hi> you haue a different reading; <hi>His indignation he kept alwaies;</hi> and in <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thewes</hi> Bible, <hi>he kept indignation alwaies by him.</hi> The reading is agreeable with the <hi>vulgar Latin;</hi> and is admitted by <hi>Oecolam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>padius,</hi> by <hi>Calvin,</hi> by <hi>Druſius.</hi> By <hi>Brentius</hi> alſo; but that for <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation,</hi> he hath <hi>furie. He kept his furie alwaies.</hi> The meaning is: the <hi>indignation,</hi> or <hi>furie,</hi> which <hi>Edom</hi> had conceiued againſt his <hi>brother,</hi> was permanent, it would not bee remitted, there was no end of it. The word in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> rendred by <hi>wrath,</hi> or <hi>indignation,</hi> or <hi>furie,</hi> ſignifieth <hi>iram vehementiorem, &amp; exaeſtua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>We now ſee, what it is, for which the LORD, in this laſt branch, reproveth <hi>Edom,</hi> or the <hi>Idumaeans.</hi> It is their <hi>implacable, vnmeaſurable,</hi> &amp; <hi>endleſſe anger;</hi> wherein they practiſed nothing but wiles, how they might intrap, and ſubvert the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi> The leſſon, which from hence we are to take for our further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:1729:107"/> is this,
<q>Whoſoever, once provoked vnto anger, doth for ever hold it faſt, and cheriſh it, he is not at any hand approved by God.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I will not ſpend many words in the proofe of this <hi>propoſition,</hi> ſith it ſtandeth good by my former diſcourſe. You haue alrea-heard, <hi>that every child of God ought to keepe himſelfe vnspotted of anger;</hi> and that, either in reſpect of its foule <hi>effects,</hi> or in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Gods <hi>holy commandement</hi> againſt it. Now is there any of you ſo devoid of Chriſtian vnderſtanding, as to thinke, or imagine, that God will at any hand <hi>approue</hi> that, againſt which he giveth his <hi>commandement?</hi> I aſſure my ſelfe, there is none. Well then, I thus inferre; <hi>whoſoever is ſpotted with evill anger, he is not at any hand approued by God:</hi> therfore, <hi>whoſoever once pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked vnto evill anger, doth for ever hold it faſt, and cheriſh it, hee is not at any hand approved by God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For further corroboration of this doctrine giue eare, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, to the bleſſed Apoſtles words, Epheſ. 4.26. <hi>Let not the ſunne goe downe vpon your wrath.</hi> Some doe thus paraphraſe theſe words<note n="m" place="margin">Guerricus ſerm. in dic Purificat.

            <p>There is nothing more adverſe, or oppoſite to our bounden dutie of charitie, and our owne <hi>ſalvation,</hi> then <hi>perſeverance</hi> in <hi>wrath.</hi> It letteth vs from doing good to thoſe with whom wee are <hi>angry:</hi> it hindreth our devotion in prayer, and maketh the wrath of God to light vpon vs. So true is my propounded do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
<q>Whoſoever once provoked vnto anger, doth for ever hold it faſt, and cheriſh it, he is not at any hand approved by God.</q>

            <p>This is it, into the commendation whereof the ſweete ſinger of <hi>Iſrael</hi> breaketh out, Pſal. 133.1. <hi>Behold how good, and comelie a thing it is, for brethren to dwell even togither?</hi> If either profit or pleaſure can allure you; then <hi>behold]</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider well, and weigh ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly <hi>how good]</hi> how profitable, and neceſſary; and <hi>how come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly]</hi> how pleaſant, and excellent, <hi>a thing it is; for brethren]</hi> not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>naturall brethren,</hi> but <hi>brethren in Chriſt,</hi> all the ſons of God, the members of his Church, and partakers of the ſelfe ſame do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and life in Chriſt; <hi>to dwell even togither]</hi> not only in one houſe, but ſpecially to be of one affection, &amp; conſent: to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine betweene themſelues brotherly loue &amp; mutuall conſent. <hi>Behold how good, how comely a thing it is, for brethren to dwell to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither in vnity.</hi> It is as the <hi>ſweet perfume</hi> and <hi>ointment,</hi> that holy oile, which was powred vpon the <hi>head</hi> of the high Prieſt, and ran downe vpon his <hi>beard,</hi> and ſo to the <hi>skirts</hi> of his garment: it is as the <hi>dew of</hi> Hermon, <hi>which fell vpon the mountaines of Sion.</hi> Both theſe reſemblances, recommending vnto vs, the pleaſure, and profit of <hi>vnity, brotherly loue,</hi> and <hi>concord,</hi> I commended vnto you in my 16.

            </p>

            <list>
               <item>1 The puniſher: the LORD. <hi>I will ſend.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2 The puniſhment: by fire. <hi>I will ſend a fire.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3 The puniſhed: the <hi>Temanites,</hi> and <hi>Bozrites,</hi> the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of both cities: <hi>I will ſend a fire vpon</hi> Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, <hi>and it ſhall devoure the palaces of</hi> Bozrah.</item>
            </list>
            <p>The puniſher, is the LORD; for, <hi>Thus ſaith the</hi> LORD; <hi>I will ſend.</hi> The doctrine naturally ariſing hence is this.</p>
            <q>It is proper to the <hi>LORD</hi> to execute vengeance vpon the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for their ſinnes.</q>
            <pb n="211" facs="tcp:1729:110"/>
            <p>This truth hath heretofore once, and againe, beene confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med vnto you. The leſſe need haue I now to inſiſt vpon it. Yet may I not paſſe it over vnſaluted. <hi>It is proper to the</hi> LORD <hi>to execute vengeance, &amp;c.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This office of <hi>executing vengeance vpon the wicked for their ſins,</hi> God taketh vpon himſelfe, Deut. 32.35. Where hee ſaith, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>engeance and recompence are mine.</hi> This is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſed to be God his due by <hi>S. Paule,</hi> Rom. 12.19. <hi>It is written, vengeance is mine, I will repay, ſaith the</hi> LORD, and by the author of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> chap. 10.30. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>engeance belongeth vnto me, I will recompenſe, ſaith the</hi> LORD; and by the ſweete ſinger of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Pſal. 94.1. <hi>O</hi> LORD <hi>God the avenger, O God the avenger.</hi> The Prophet <hi>Nahum,</hi> chap. 1.2. to the terrour of the wicked, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimeth it: <hi>God is iealous, and the</hi> LORD <hi>revengeth: the</hi> LORD <hi>revengeth: even the</hi> LORD <hi>of anger; the</hi> LORD <hi>will take venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance on his adverſaries, and reſerveth wrath for his enemies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe places are ſo many pregnant proofes to make good my propounded doctrine: namely, that, <hi>It is proper to the</hi> LORD <hi>to execute vengeance vpon the wicked for their ſinnes.</hi> Many are the vſes of this doctrine.</p>
            <p>The firſt. It may leſſon vs to looke heedfully vnto our feete, that we walke not in the way of <hi>ſinners,</hi> to partake with them in their ſinnes. <hi>Sinnes</hi> are not tongue-tied; they <hi>cry</hi> vnto the LORD for vengeance. Wee read in holy writ of foure ſorts of ſinnes, which aboue other, do <hi>cry</hi> vnto God, and do call for his great, and quicke vengeance.</p>
            <p>The firſt is <hi>Homicide, murther,</hi> or <hi>manſlaughter;</hi> whereof Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, Gen. 4.10. thus ſpeaketh vnto <hi>Caine; The voice of thy brothers blood</hi> cryeth <hi>vnto me from the earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond is <hi>Sodomie,</hi> the ſinne of <hi>Sodom,</hi> the ſinne againſt nature, a ſinne not once to be named among Chriſtians. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of thus ſaith the LORD vnto <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 18.20. <hi>Becauſe the</hi> cry <hi>of Sodom and Gomorah is great, and becauſe their ſinne is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding grievous, I will go downe now, and ſee whether they haue done altogether according to the</hi> cry, <hi>which is come vnto me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third is <hi>oppreſſion</hi> of the <hi>poore; widowes, fatherleſſe,</hi> and

            <p>The fourth is, the <hi>keeping backe of the labourers hire.</hi> Whereof S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

            <p>Thus much of the firſt vſe; which was, to leſſon vs to looke heedfully to our feet, that we walke not in the way of ſinners, to partake with them in their ſinnes. I proceed.</p>
            <p>Is it true? Is it <hi>proper to God to execute vengeance vpon the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for their ſinnes?</hi> Here then in the ſecond place we are admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, not to intermedle in the <hi>Lords office.</hi> It is his <hi>office</hi> to <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute ve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geance.</hi> We therefore may not interpoſe our ſelues. If a brother, a neighbour, or a ſtranger hath done vs any wrong, we muſt <hi>forgiue</hi> him, &amp; muſt leaue <hi>revengement</hi> to God, to whom it appertaineth.

            <p>The firſt is; The <hi>forgiuenes of our own ſins.</hi> Whereof thus ſaith our Saviour, Luk. 6.37. <hi>Forgiue, and you ſhall be forgiven.</hi>

Look, what grace, and indulgence, we ſhew vnto our neighbours, the like will God ſhew vnto vs. What els is ſaid, Luk. 6.38? <hi>With what meaſure you mete, with the ſame ſhall it be meaſured to you againe.</hi> Whereof I cannot giue a plainer expoſition the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in our Saviours words, Mat. 6.14, 15. <hi>If yee do forgiue men their treſpaſſes, your heavenly Father will alſo forgiue you.

            </p>
            <p>A ſecond reaſon why we ſhould <hi>forgiue our enimies,</hi> is, that <hi>when we make our prayers vnto God, we, our ſelues, may bee heard.</hi> For God heareth not the praiers of ſuch, as do abide in ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cour, and will not <hi>forgiue their enimies.</hi> It's well ſaid of an<note n="g" place="margin">Auguſtin.</note> ancient: <hi>Qui non vult dimittere fratri ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The moſt abſolute, and excellent platforme of <hi>prayer,</hi> that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was made, and is by the maker thereof, our LORD, and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> commended vnto vs for our dayly vſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth this point vnto vs. The fift petition therein, is; that God would be pleaſed to <hi>forgiue vs our treſpaſſes, as we forgiue them, that trespaſſe againſt vs.</hi> Wherefore as in all ſincerity we deſire our ſelues to be looked vpon with the <hi>eies</hi> of <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>mercy,</hi> from heaven, without any fraud, or hollownes, or diſſimulation in the LORD: ſo are wee taught by that clauſe, our ſelues to
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:1729:113"/> deale with others; ſo truely, ſo honeſtly, ſo heartily, ſo ſincerely, and vnfainedly forgiving ever, as we may boldly ſay: <hi>ſo</hi> LORD, <hi>do thou to me, as I to others.</hi> Now if theſe hearts of ours bee ſo ſturdy, &amp; ſtrong in their corruption, as that they wil not relent, and yeeld to <hi>forgiue</hi> ſuch, as haue <hi>trespaſſed againſt vs,</hi> how can we looke that our praiers ſhould take effect?</p>
            <p>A third reaſon, why we ſhould <hi>forgiue our enimies,</hi> is, <hi>that our good workes may be acceptable vnto God.</hi> Let a man every day do as many <hi>good works,</hi> as there are ſtars in Heave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; yet as long as in <hi>heart</hi> he beareth <hi>hatred</hi> to his enimie, God will not accept anie one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. <hi>Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

Paul,</hi> 1. Cor. 13.3. <hi>Though I feed the poore with all my goods, and though I giue my body, that I be burned, &amp; haue not loue, it profiteth me nothing.</hi> If then, wee would haue our good workes pleaſing vnto God, we muſt be reconciled to our neighbours.

            </p>
            <p>A fourth reaſon, why we ſhould <hi>forgiue our enimies,</hi> is, <hi>that our ſoules may liue:</hi> for by <hi>hatred,</hi> &amp; <hi>rancour,</hi> we <hi>ſlay</hi> our ſoules. S. Ioh. ep. 1. chap. 3. verſe 15. avoweth it; that he, <hi>whoſoever ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth his brother, is a manſlayer. Homicidieſt, ſcilicet propriae a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimae,</hi> ſaith<note n="k" place="margin">Pet. de Pal. vbi ſupra.</note> one, he is a murtherer of his owne ſoule. An ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition not abſolutely to be diſallowed, for as much as it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth in the ſame verſe; <hi>Yee know that no manſlayer hath eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life abiding in him.</hi> The <hi>life</hi> of the ſoule is <hi>loue;</hi> therefore hee that <hi>loueth not,</hi> is <hi>dead.</hi> So ſaith the ſame bleſſed Apoſtle, Ep. 1. cap. 3. verſe 14. <hi>He that loveth not his brother, abideth in death.</hi> And greater is the dammage by the loſſe of <hi>one ſoule,</hi> then of a <hi>thouſand bodies.</hi> The <hi>whole world</hi> in reſpect of <hi>one ſoule,</hi> is not to be eſteemed. This is proved by our Saviours queſtion, Marc. 8.36. <hi>What ſhal it profit a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, though he ſhold win the whole world,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:1729:113"/> if he looſe his owne ſoule?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A fift reaſon, why we ſhould <hi>loue our enimies,</hi> is <hi>the reioycing of Saints, and Angels. To loue our enimies,</hi> is an infallible ſigne of our <hi>converſion.</hi> Now we know by Luk. 15.7. that <hi>there ſhall be ioy in Heaven for one ſinner, that converteth:</hi> and verſe the 10. <hi>that there is ioy in the preſence of the Angels of God for one ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that converteth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus whether we reſpect the <hi>reioicing of Saints, and Angels; or the life of our ſoules;</hi> or the <hi>acceptance of our good works;</hi> or <hi>the fruit of our prayers;</hi> or <hi>the forgiueneſſe of our ſinnes;</hi> we muſt <hi>loue our enimies:</hi> after <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Stephen</hi> his example, Act. 7.60. LORD <hi>lay not this ſinne to their charge:</hi> after S. <hi>Paule</hi> his example, 1. Cor. 4.12, 13. <hi>We are reviled, and yet we bleſſe: wee are perſecuted, and ſuffer it: we are evill spoken of, and we pray:</hi> after <hi>Chriſts</hi> example, Luk. 23.34. <hi>Father forgiue them, for they knowe not what they doe.</hi> Adde hereto <hi>Chriſts</hi> commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, Math. 5.44. <hi>Loue your enimies; bleſſe them that curſe you; doe good to them that hate you; and pray for them that hurt you, and perſecute you.</hi> Leaue yee <hi>vengeance</hi> to the <hi>God</hi> of <hi>vengeance;</hi> ſo ſhall yee bee the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted children of your heavenly Father. And thus farre of the ſecond vſe; which was to admoniſh vs, not to intermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle in the <hi>Lords office</hi> of executing <hi>revengement.</hi> A third follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
            <p>Is it true? <hi>Is it proper to the</hi> LORD <hi>to execute vengeance vpon the wicked for their ſinnes?</hi> Here then in the third place, is a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurie, of <hi>comfort,</hi> &amp; of <hi>terrour:</hi> of <hi>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort</hi> to the Godly, of <hi>terrour</hi> to the wicked. For though the LORD doe vſe the wicked, to correct the Godly; yet will he in due time overthrow the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with a large meaſure of his iudgements, and free the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Gods holy practiſe in this kind, muſt be hereof a warrant vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were kept in thraldome, and bondage, many yeares by the <hi>Egyptians.</hi> The <hi>Egyptians,</hi> they were but <hi>the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of Gods wrath;</hi> wherewith hee afflicted his people. They were <hi>Gods weapons.</hi> Were they therefore to eſcape vnpuniſhed? No. Witneſſe thoſe <hi>ten great plagues</hi> which at length God
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:1729:114"/> wrought vpon them, and their fearefull overthrow in the redde ſea, at large ſet downe in the book of <hi>Exodus,</hi> from the 7. chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the 14. This was it, which God ſaid to <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 15. verſ. 13, 14. <hi>Knowe for a ſuretie, that thy ſeed ſhall be a ſtranger in a land that is not theirs, foure hundred yeares, and ſhall ſerue them; notwithſtanding the nation whom they ſhall ſerue, will I iudge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ahab,</hi> the moſt wicked of the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who <hi>ſold</hi> him ſelfe to worke wickedneſſe in the ſight of the LORD, and his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed wife, <hi>Iezebel,</hi> were <hi>Gods inſtruments</hi> to afflict <hi>Naboth,</hi> with the loſſe of his life and vineyard. <hi>Ahab</hi> &amp; <hi>Iezebel,</hi> were <hi>Gods inſtruments:</hi> were they therefore to eſcape <hi>vnpuniſhed?</hi> NO. Witnes both their ends. The end of <hi>Ahab,</hi> recorded, 1. King. 22 38. <hi>In the place where dogges licked the blood of</hi> Naboth, <hi>did dogges licke the blood of</hi> Ahab <hi>alſo.</hi> And the end of <hi>Iezebel;</hi> regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred, 2.

            <p>It was a part of <hi>Daniel</hi> his afflictions, to be <hi>caſt into the denne of Lyons;</hi> his accuſers vnto <hi>Darius</hi> were the <hi>inſtruments,</hi> of this his affliction. Theſe his accuſers were the <hi>Lords inſtruments,</hi> for this buſineſſe. Were they therefore to eſcape <hi>vnpuniſhed?</hi> No. Their fearefull end is ſet downe, Dan. 6.24. <hi>By the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of King</hi> Darius, <hi>they with their wiues, and children, were caſt into the denne of Lyons; the Lyons had the maſterie of them, and brake all their bones in pieces, yer ever they came to the ground of the denne.</hi>

<pb n="219" facs="tcp:1729:114"/> from heaven, with his holy Angels in flaming fire, that then to the <hi>wicked,</hi> whoſe behaviour to the <hi>godly,</hi> hath beene proud, &amp; diſpiteous, hee will render <hi>vengeance</hi> and <hi>puniſh</hi> them with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting perdition. Thus farre of the firſt circumſtance, &amp; do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine therevpon.</p>
            <p>The ſecond circumſtance is the puniſhment. <hi>I wil ſend a fire]</hi> By <hi>fire</hi> in this place as verſ. 4, 7, 10. learned expoſitors doe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, not ſo much a <hi>naturall fire,</hi> as a <hi>figuratiue fire.</hi> For in the name of <hi>fire,</hi> they vnderſtand the ſword, peſtilence, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, <hi>quodlibet genus conſumptionis,</hi> every kind of conſumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; <hi>quamlibet speciem excidij,</hi> every kind of deſtruction; be it haile, or thunder, or ſickneſſe, or any other of Gods meſſengers. So large is the ſignification of <hi>fire,</hi> taken <hi>figuratiuely.</hi> The doctrine ariſing hence, is this.</p>
            <q>The fire (<hi>whether</hi> naturall, <hi>or</hi> figuratiue) <hi>that is,</hi> the fire, &amp; all other creatures, are at the Lords commandement, to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed by him in the puniſhment of the wicked.</q>
            <p>This doctrine hath heretofore beene commended, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed vnto you.</p>
            <p>The vſe of it, is, to teach vs how to behaue our ſelues, at ſuch times as God ſhall <hi>viſite</hi> vs with his <hi>rod</hi> of correction: how to carry our ſelues in all our <hi>afflictions.</hi> We muſt not ſo much look to the <hi>inſtruments,</hi> as to the LORD that ſmiteth by them. If the <hi>fire,</hi> or <hi>water,</hi> or any other of Gods creatures ſhall at any time rage, and prevaile againſt vs, we muſt remember that it is God, that ſendeth them, to worke his holy will vpon vs. Here he ſent <hi>a fire</hi> vpon <hi>Teman,</hi> and vpon <hi>Bozrah</hi> to <hi>devoure her palaces.</hi> For <hi>thus ſaith the</hi> LORD: <hi>I will ſend a fire vpon</hi> Teman, <hi>and it ſhall devoure the palaces of</hi> Bozrah.</p>
            <p>Here haue you the third circumſtance; the circumſtance of the puniſhed: <hi>Teman</hi> and the <hi>palaces of</hi> Bozrah. <hi>Teman</hi> was the metropolitan, the chiefe city of <hi>Idumaea,</hi> ſo named from <hi>Teman,</hi> who was ſon of <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Eſau,</hi> Gen. 26.10, 11. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned and famous was <hi>Teman</hi> for her wiſedome; witnes the prophecie of <hi>Obadiah,</hi> verſ. 8, 9. and <hi>Ierem.</hi> 49.7. whereby, it is credible, ſhee omitted no opportunity, no meanes, to make her
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:1729:115"/> ſelfe ſtrong by bulwarkes, and fortreſſes, againſt whatſoever incurſion; or ſiege of enimies. Yet could ſhee not hereby be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured againſt the day of <hi>Gods viſitation;</hi> when for the comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of her ſins, God ſhould lay his heavy <hi>rod</hi> vpon her. What the wit of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> could invent for ſafety, no doubt, but <hi>Teman</hi> had it. But what can mans wit do againſt the <hi>Almighty.</hi> Behold here, in my text, thus ſaith the <hi>Almighty: I will ſend a fire vpon</hi> Teman. And can all the water of the huge Ocean, quench the <hi>fire</hi> of the <hi>Almighty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This reſolution of the LORD for the overthrow of <hi>Teman,</hi> is excellently ſet down by the Prophet <hi>Obadiah,</hi> ver. 8, 9, 10. <hi>Shall not I, in that day ſaith the</hi> LORD, <hi>even deſtroy the wiſe men out of</hi> Edom, <hi>&amp; vnderſtanding from the mount of</hi> Eſau? <hi>And thy ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, O</hi> Tema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. <hi>ſhall be afraid, becauſe every one of the mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of</hi> Eſau, <hi>ſhall be cut of by ſlaughter. For thy cruelty againſt thy brother</hi> Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, <hi>ſhame ſhall cover thee, and thou ſhalt be cut of for ever.</hi> The Prophet <hi>Ieremie</hi> to this purpoſe, chap. 49.7. bringeth in the LORD <hi>of heaſts</hi> thus queſtioning with <hi>Edom: Is wiſdom no more in</hi> Teman? <hi>Is counſaile periſhed from their children? Is their wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome vaniſhed?</hi> As if he had ſaid; the wiſedome of <hi>Teman</hi> is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come fooliſhneſſe; their counſaile is nothing worth. And why? But becauſe as my text ſaith; <hi>God will ſend a fire vpon</hi> Teman. The doctrine hence ariſing is,
<q>No wiſdome, no counſaile, no humane invention can ſaue that city, which God will haue deſtroyed.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The reaſon hereof, is: becauſe there is no <hi>ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth,</hi> but of God &amp; from God. The vſe is: to teach vs, never to truſt in any <hi>world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> helpe, but ſo to vſe all good meanes of our defence, that ſtill we relie vpon the LORD, for ſtrength, and ſucceſſe thereby.</p>
            <p>Againe this <hi>fire</hi> of the LORD is ſent to devoure <hi>the palaces of Bozrah.</hi> This <hi>Bozrah</hi> was alſo a metropolitane, and chiefe city, ſeated in the confines of the lands of <hi>Edom,</hi> &amp; <hi>Moab:</hi> &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in holy writ it is ſometime attributed to <hi>Edom,</hi> ſometime to <hi>Moab.</hi> Here to <hi>Edom.</hi> Prodigious was the feare, and great the pride of <hi>Bozrahs</hi> heart. <hi>Shee dwelt in the clefts of the rocke, and kept the height of the hill.</hi> But was ſhee thereby ſafe? No.
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:1729:115"/> For <hi>thus ſaith the</hi> LORD vnto her, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 49.16. <hi>Though thou ſhouldeſt make thy neſt, as high as the Eagle, I will bring thee down from thence.</hi> This iudgement of the LORD againſt <hi>Bozrah,</hi> is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced with an <hi>Ecce</hi> of admiration, verſ. 22. <hi>Behold, hee</hi> (the LORD) <hi>ſhall come vp, and fly as the Eagle, and spread his wings o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> Bozrah, <hi>and at that day ſhall the heart of the ſtrong men of</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom <hi>be, as the heart of a woman in travell.</hi> Will you haue it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by an oath?

            <p>
               <hi>Bozrah,</hi> great <hi>Bozrah,</hi> ſhe who dwelt in <hi>the clefts of the rock,</hi> and <hi>kept the height of the hill,</hi> muſt ſhe be devoured by <hi>fire</hi> from the LORD? Muſt ſhee become a <hi>reproach,</hi> a <hi>deſolation,</hi> a <hi>curſe,</hi> a <hi>vaſtity?</hi> We may hence take this doctrine,
<q>It is not the ſituation of a city vpon rocke, or hill, that can bee a ſafegard to it, if Gods vnappeaſable anger break out againſt it, for her ſinnes.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The vſe of this doctrine is the ſame with the former; even to teach vs, now, and at all other times; to put our truſt only in the Name of the LORD, who hath made heaven &amp; earth.

Wherefore let our ſong bee, as <hi>Davids</hi> was, Pſal. 18.2. <hi>The</hi> LORD <hi>is our rocke, &amp; our fortreſſe; he that delivereth vs; our God, &amp; our ſtrength; in him wil we truſt: our ſhield; the horne alſo of our ſalvation, and our refuge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, in that the LORD ſendeth his <hi>fire</hi> into <hi>the palaces of</hi> Bozrah to <hi>devoure them,</hi> we may learne this doctrine,
<q>God depriveth vs of a great bleſſing, when he taketh from vs our dwelling houſes.</q>
            </p>
            <p>A truth experimentally made good vnto vs by the great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <item>1 A generall accuſation of the <hi>Ammonites:</hi> who are here noted, as reproueable for many ſinnes: <hi>For three tranſgreſſions of the children of</hi> Ammon, <hi>and for foure.</hi>

               </item>
               <item>3 A particular declaration of one ſinne, which with others procured this prophecy. This ſinne was the ſinne of <hi>cruelty</hi> expreſſed in theſe words: <hi>Becauſe they haue ript vp the vvomen vvith childe of</hi> Gilead: &amp; amplified, by the end of ſo foule a fact: <hi>That they might enlarge their borders.</hi>

               <item>4 A denuntiation of iudgement, which was to come vpon them, deſervedly, for their ſinnes, ver. 14, and 15. This iudgement is ſet downe,</item>

            <p>This iudgement is further amplified, by the <hi>extent</hi> of it. It was to fall vpon, not only the meaner ſort of the people, but vpon the nobility alſo, yea, and vpon the <hi>King</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.

            <p>The ſumme is: if the <hi>Ammonites</hi> had offended but once, or a ſecond time. I would haue beene favourable to them, &amp; would haue recald them into the right way, that ſo they might be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<q>Many ſinnes doe plucke downe from heaven the moſt certaine wrath and vengeance of God vpon the ſinners.</q>
            </p>
            <p>God is of pure eies, and beholdeth not iniquity. Hee hath laid righteouſnes to the rule, and weighed his iuſtice in a ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance. The ſentence is paſſed forth, and muſt ſtand vncontroule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, even as long as the ſunne, and moone: <hi>Tribulation and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh vpon every ſoule that doth evill.</hi> The ſoule that ſinneth, it ſhall be puniſhed. God makes it good by an oath, Deut. 32.41. <hi>That he will what his glittering ſword, and his hand ſhall take hold on iudgement, to execute vengeance for ſinne.</hi> His ſoule hateth, &amp; abhorreth ſinne; his law curſeth &amp; condemneth ſinne; his hand ſmiteth &amp; ſcourgeth ſinne. Sinne was his motiue to caſt downe Angels into Hell; to thruſt <hi>Adam</hi> out of Paradiſe; to turne ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties into Aſhes; to ruinate nations; to torment his own bowels
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:1729:119"/> in the ſimilitude of ſinnefull fleſh. Becauſe of ſinne, he drowned the old worlde; and becauſe of ſinne ere long will burne this. Thus do many ſinnes plucke, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>One vſe of this doctrine is: to teach vs heedfulneſſe in al our waies; that we doe not by <hi>our many ſinnes</hi> provoke Almightie God to high diſpleaſure.</p>
            <p>A ſecond vſe is, to moue vs to a ſerious contemplation of the wonderfull patience of Almighty God, who did ſoe graciouſly forbeare theſe <hi>children of Ammo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> til by <hi>three &amp; foure tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,</hi> by <hi>their many ſinnes</hi> they provoked him to indignation. Theſe thinges I haue heretofore laboured to lay vnto your hearts.</p>
            <p>Now therefore I proceede to the thirde part of this prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie: wherein you haue the declaration of that <hi>grievous ſinne,</hi> by which the <hi>children of Ammon</hi> ſo highly offended. This their ſinne, was the ſinne of <hi>cruelty:</hi> expreſſed in theſe words: <hi>Becauſe they haue ript vp the women with childe of</hi> Gilead: and amplified by the end of ſo foule a fact; <hi>That they might enlarge their bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</hi>

The <hi>women,</hi> vpon whom this <hi>cruelty</hi> was practiſed, are here ſaid to haue beene of <hi>Gilead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of this land of <hi>Gilead</hi> I haue heretofore largely ſpoken in my <hi>ſeaventh Lecture</hi> vpon this prophecie, occaſioned by the 3. ver. of this chapter, where it is obiected to the <hi>Syrians</hi> of <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> that they <hi>threſhed</hi> Gilead <hi>with threſhing inſtruments of yron.</hi> The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I ſhewed; that the land of <hi>Gilead,</hi> was poſſeſſed by the <hi>Reube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites, Gadites;</hi> and <hi>halfe tribe of Manaſſeh,</hi> Num. 32.33. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is plaine, that the <hi>Gileadites</hi> were <hi>Iſraelites.</hi> Here the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theſe <hi>women,</hi> with whom the <hi>Ammonites</hi> dealt ſo barbarouſly, as to <hi>rip them vp,</hi> when they were <hi>great with childe,</hi> were of <hi>Iacobs</hi> poſterity: they were <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> the <hi>lot,</hi> and <hi>portion of Gods owne inheritance.</hi> For ſo prodigious a <hi>cruelty,</hi> we ſee Almighty God is here reſolved to be avenged on the <hi>children of Ammon.</hi> The doctrine ariſing hence is this,
<q>Cruelty is a ſinne very hatefull vnto God.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This doctrine I haue heretofore out of this place, confirmed vnto you: it is alſo plainely grounded vpon my text: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I paſſe it over.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Theſe words of my text; <hi>They haue ript vp women with childe of</hi> Gilead, do yeeld vs another profitable doctrine. <hi>They,</hi> that is, <hi>the children of Ammon,</hi> profeſſed enimies to God, and godly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, haue raged againſt the <hi>Gileadites, Iacobs</hi> poſterity, the <hi>lot,</hi> and <hi>portion of Gods inheritance,</hi> even to the <hi>ripping vp of their women with childe.</hi> The doctrine is,
<q>God often humbleth his choſen children, vnder the rod of the wicked.</q> This truth appeareth in <hi>Lot,</hi> ſore preſſed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the <hi>Sodomites;</hi> Gen. 19.9. in the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> hardly dealt with by the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> Exod. 1.11. in the <hi>ſeaventy brethren,</hi> ſonnes of <hi>Ierubbaal,</hi> perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted by <hi>Abimelech,</hi> moſt of them to the death; Iudg. 9.5. in <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remie,</hi> twiſe evill intreated; firſt <hi>beaten,</hi> and <hi>put in the ſtockes</hi> by <hi>Paſhure,</hi> Ierem. 20.2. and a ſecond time <hi>beaten,</hi> and <hi>impriſoned</hi> by <hi>Zedechias</hi> his nobles; chap. 37.15. in the <hi>three children,</hi> caſt into the fiery fornace, by <hi>Nabuchodonoſor,</hi> Dan. 3.21.</p>
            <p>Many like examples might bee extracted out of Gods holie regiſter, for proofe of this point: which alſo may be made fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to appeare vnto you, in thoſe bloody perſecutions after
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:1729:121"/> Chriſt his death, by the Roman Emperours, who deviſed ſtrange torments to keepe downe religion, and religious profeſſours, men and women. <hi>They plucked of their skinnes quicke: they boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out their eies with nimbles: they broyled them aliue on gredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous: they ſcalded them in boiling liquors: they encloſed them in barrels, through which great nailes were driven, and therein they tumbled them downe mountaines, till their owne blood ſo cruelly drawne out, had ſtifled and choaked them in the barrells: womens brests, were Jeared of with burning irons, their bodies were rent, &amp; their ioints racked.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sundry other, and as ſtrange kindes of torments, were endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the faithful, in the time of the <hi>ten firſt perſecutions</hi> in the primitiue Church. This is it which <hi>S. Peter</hi> hath epiſt. 1. chap. 4. verſ. 17. <hi>The time is come, that iudgement muſt begin at the houſe of God.</hi> Yet let not the faithfull hereat be diſcouraged. It is for their good. <hi>Iob,</hi> an vpright, &amp; a iuſt man, one that feared God, and eſchewed evill, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his experience of the afflictions which he endured vnder the rod of Gods correction, chap. 5.17. ſaith: <hi>Behold, bleſſed is the man whom God correcteth: therefore refuſe not thou the chaſtning of the Almightie. For he maketh the wound and bindeth it vp; he ſmiteth, and his hands make whole.</hi> And thus from my doctrine, I proceed to the vſes. I will but point at the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
            <p>Is it true (beloued?) Doth God often <hi>humble his choſen chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren vnder the rod of the wicked?</hi> It may firſt ſhew vs, how great Gods <hi>anger</hi> is for ſinne, that he puniſheth it ſo ſeverely even in his <hi>deareſt children,</hi> and thereby may worke in vs a <hi>loathing, hatred,</hi> and <hi>deteſtation of ſinne.</hi> Never more need then now, to ſmite our breaſts, &amp; pray with the publicane, <hi>O God, be merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vnto vs ſinners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, it may teach vs not to meaſure the <hi>favour of God</hi> towards our ſelues, or others, by the <hi>adverſities,</hi> or <hi>croſſes</hi> of this life. Here we ſee, that the <hi>women of Gilead,</hi> of the race of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> Gods owne <hi>lot,</hi> and <hi>inheritance</hi> were moſt barbarouſly &amp; <hi>cruelly ript vp by the Ammonites.</hi> Yet are we not to doubt, but that <hi>Gods favour</hi> was great towards them, even in this ſevere puniſhment.</p>
            <pb n="233" facs="tcp:1729:121"/>
            <p>Thirdly, it may make vs, poure out our ſoules in thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe before Almightie God for our preſent eſtate, and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It is not with vs, as in the daies of <hi>Gilead,</hi> we are not <hi>thre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with threſhing inſtruments of yron; our women with child are not ript vp.</hi> Our daies are the daies of <hi>peace;</hi> our King is a king of <hi>peace. Peace</hi> is in our ports; <hi>peace</hi> in all our borders, and <hi>peace</hi> within our wals.<note n="l" place="margin">Pſal. 144.12.</note> 
               <hi>Our ſonnes doe grow vp as young plants; our daughters are as the poliſhed corners of the temple. Our garners are full, and plenteous with al maner of ſtore. Our ſheep bring forth thouſands, and ten thouſands. Our oxen are ſtrong to labour. Here is no invaſion, no leading into captivitie, no complaining in our ſtreets.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Are not the people happy that are in ſuch a caſe? Yes ſaith the Pſalmiſt, Pſal. 144.15. <hi>Happy are the people that are in ſuch a caſe.</hi> The caſe you ſee is ours. The <hi>God of peace,</hi> which maketh an<note n="m" place="margin">Pſal. 46.10.</note> 
               <hi>end of warre in all the world, and breaketh the bow, and knap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth the speares aſunder, and burneth the chariots with fire:</hi> hee doth now protect vs from <hi>warre,</hi> and <hi>ſlaughter. Quid repende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus?</hi> What ſhall we render vnto the LORD, for all his benefits towards vs? We will take the <hi>cup of ſalvation,</hi> and <hi>praiſe his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly name.</hi> O our ſoules, <hi>praiſe the</hi> LORD; for hee onely maketh vs to dwell in ſafetie. Thus farre of the <hi>cruell fact</hi> of the <hi>Ammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites, in ripping vp the women with child of Gilead.</hi> This their fact is amplified by the end, wherefore they did it; <hi>They haue ript vp the women with child of Gilead, that they might enlarge their border.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That they might enlarge their border?</hi> What could ſuch cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie againſt innocent and harmeleſſe women, further them to the attaining of ſuch an end? Very much. For hereby it might come to paſſe, that there ſhould not be any <hi>ofſpring</hi> of the <hi>Gile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adites</hi> to <hi>inherit,</hi> and <hi>poſſeſſe the land;</hi> ſo might the <hi>land</hi> without any reſiſtance become the <hi>poſſeſſion</hi> of the <hi>Ammonites.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is by a propheticall conteſtation touched, Ierem. 49.1. Vnto the children of <hi>Ammo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi> thus ſaith the LORD; <hi>Hath</hi> Iſrael <hi>no ſonnes?</hi> or <hi>hath he no heires? Why then hath their King poſſeſſed</hi> Gad; <hi>and his people dwelt in his cities?</hi> So might this our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:1729:122"/> 
               <hi>Amos</hi> here conteſt, and make complaint: <hi>Hath</hi> Gilead <hi>no ſonnes? Hath</hi> Gilead <hi>no heires? Why then haue the</hi> Ammonites <hi>poſſeſſed</hi> Gilead? <hi>why haue they dwelt in the cities of Gilead?</hi> The anſwer is plaine out of my text; <hi>the</hi> Ammonites <hi>haue ript vp the women with child of</hi> Gilead, they haue left them <hi>no ſonnes; no heires.</hi> And ſo they <hi>poſſeſſed the land of</hi> Gilead; ſo haue they <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged their borders.</hi> Wee ſee now the meaning of our <hi>Prophet:</hi> Hee obiecteth to the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> not only that they did <hi>cruelly rip vp the wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with child in</hi> Gilead, but alſo, that they did it for this end, <hi>that they might enlarge their borders.</hi> The doctrine is,
<q>That nation, which is not content with her owne borders, but invadeth her neighbour countries, ſinneth grievouſly.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Ethnickes</hi> of old, taught but in <hi>Natures</hi> ſchoole, did hold it for a wicked act, deteſtable, and inexpiable, to remoue a neighbours <hi>land-markes.</hi> In which reſpect the old <hi>Romans</hi> worſhipped <hi>Terminus</hi> for a <hi>God. Terminus</hi> which ſignifieth, a bound, limite, meere, buttle, or land-marke, was in their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count a <hi>God,</hi> God <hi>of their bounds, limites,</hi> or <hi>markes</hi> of their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall fields, meadowes, and paſtures; and ſuch a <hi>God,</hi> as ſhould not giue place to <hi>Iupiter</hi> himſelfe.

In the <hi>ſchoole of Grace</hi> a law is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Deut. 19.14. <hi>Thou ſhalt not remoue thy neighbours marke.</hi> To obey this law we are charged vpon a curſe, Deu. 27.17. <hi>Curſed be he, that removeth his neighbours marke.</hi> It is Gods own ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance that <hi>bounds,</hi> and <hi>limits,</hi> and <hi>marks</hi> are appointed to every mans poſſeſſions. This may be gathered out of, Deut. 32.8. <hi>The moſt high</hi> [GOD,] <hi>divided to the nations their inheritances: he ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated the ſonnes of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: he did ſet the bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds of nations.</hi> The mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is: the LORD pitched the <hi>bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds</hi> of kingdomes, at ſuch time as it pleaſed him, that the nations ſhould be divided aſunder. Yet we ſee how the covetous ambition, &amp; vnſatiable deſire of ſome Princes in the world, haue put al out of order, how there
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:1729:122"/> is nothing ſo holy, that can ſtay them from incroaching vpon the <hi>bounds</hi> of their neighbours, and next borderers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nacherib</hi> King of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> was a ſtout offender in this kind. He boaſted of his invaſions and victories vpon his neighbour countries. But, that other princes may take example by him, he was made a peculiar example of divine iudgement. For as he tranſgreſſed the <hi>bounds</hi> of his neighbour princes to their over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, ſo did his owne ſonnes tranſgreſſe the <hi>bounds</hi> of nature, to the loſſe of his their fathers life. As it appeareth by Eſai 37.38. <hi>As</hi> Sennacherib <hi>was in the temple worſhipping</hi> Niſroch <hi>his God;</hi> Adramelech, <hi>&amp;</hi> Sharezer, <hi>his ſons, ſlew him with the ſword.</hi> And by my text you ſee, what iudgements God threatneth to the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> for their vnlawful practiſes to <hi>enlarge their bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi> So my doctrine is eſtabliſhed;
<q>The nation, that is not content with her owne borders, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vadeth her neighbour countries, ſinneth grievouſly.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The vſe of this doctrine may concerne vs here aſſembled. As princes ought to hold themſelues contented with their owne <hi>bounds,</hi> ſo ought every private man alſo. God hath alſo ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their poſſeſſions one fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> another, to the ende that al might liue, and communicate one with another, and that there might be no confuſed diſorder.</p>
            <p>But (beloved in the Lord) how do we ſtand to this order, ſet by Almighty God? Do we not ſeeke dayly to pervert it? God would haue it kept moſt holy; but we care not for it. Our coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſnes carrieth vs away; we would ſtill be greater. Wee <hi>ioine houſe to houſe,</hi> and <hi>field to field,</hi> as it is in Eſai. 5.8. <hi>that we may be placed by our ſelues in the middeſt of the earth.</hi> Were our Fathers ſo ambitious? They were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent with ſuch <hi>bounds,</hi> as their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors left them; but we muſt haue them altered, if not enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. The divinely-inſpired <hi>David</hi> tels vs, Pſal. 37.3. that if wee <hi>dwell in the land, where God hath placed vs, we ſhall verily bee fed.</hi> We ſhould learne of <hi>S. Paule,</hi> Philip. 4.11. <hi>in whatſoever ſtate we are, therewith to be content.</hi> Knowing it to be true, which the ſame Apoſtle avoweth vnto <hi>Timothy, Ep.</hi> 1. <hi>chap.</hi> 6. <hi>ver.</hi> 6. that <hi>Godlineſſe is great gaine, if we will be content, with that we haue.</hi> Thus much of the 13. verſe.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Of this doctrine heretofore. The vſe of it is, to teach vs, how to behaue our ſelues at ſuch times, as God ſhall viſit vs with his rod of correction: how to cary our ſelues in all our afflictions. We muſt not ſo much looke to the <hi>meanes,</hi> as to the LORD, that worketh by them. If the <hi>fire,</hi> or <hi>water,</hi> or any other of Gods cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atures ſhall at any time rage, and prevaile againſt vs, we muſt know: that <hi>God</hi> by them worketh his holy will vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs. Here we ſee, he reſolueth <hi>to kindle a fire vpon the wall of</hi> Rabbah, for thus ſaith the LORD; <hi>I will kindle a fire in the wall of</hi> Rabbah <hi>and it ſhal devoure the palaces thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was a city of this name <hi>(Rabbah)</hi> in the country of <hi>Moab,</hi> called <hi>Rabbath-Moab.</hi> So ſaith <hi>Druſius.</hi> But the <hi>Rabbah</hi> in my text, was a city in the country of the <hi>Ammonites;</hi> called, 2. Sam. 12.26. <hi>Rabbah of the children of</hi> Ammon: where it is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>the city of the kingdome.</hi> For it was their metropolitical, &amp; chiefe city. In the verſe following it's called <hi>the city of waters,</hi> becauſe it was ſituate neere vnto the river <hi>Ieboc.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The deſtruction here threatned to this city, is likewiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced by two other Prophets; <hi>Ieremy,</hi> and <hi>Ezechiel.</hi> In <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,</hi> chap. 49.2. <hi>Thus ſaith the</hi> LORD: <hi>I will cauſe a noiſe of war to be heard in</hi> Rabbah <hi>of the Ammonites, and it ſhall be a deſolate heape, and her daughters ſhall be burnt with fire. Cry yee daughters of</hi> Rabbah; <hi>gird you with ſackecloath: mourne, and runne to &amp; fro
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:1729:124"/> by the hedges: for their king ſhall goe into captivity, and his prieſts &amp; his princes likewiſe.</hi> And <hi>Ezechiel, chap.</hi> 25.5. <hi>I will make</hi> Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bah <hi>a dwelling place for Camels: and the Ammonites a ſheepcoate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By which two places of <hi>Ieremy,</hi> &amp; <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> the meaning of my Prophet is opened. Here in the perſon of God he ſaith: <hi>I wil kindle a fire in the wall of</hi> Rabbah, <hi>and it ſhall devoure the palaces thereof.</hi> It is, as if he had ſaid. The<note n="a" place="margin">Ierem. 7.34.</note> voice of mirth, and the voice of gladnes ſhall ceaſe to be heard in <hi>Rabbah;</hi> the noiſe of warre ſhall bee heard there; and I will make it a dwelling place for Camels, a ſheepecoate, an heape of deſolation.</p>
            <p>Muſt <hi>Rabbah,</hi> the chiefe city of the kingdome, be meaſured with the line of deſolation? It yeelds vs this doctrine,
<q>It is not the greatnes of a city that can be a ſafegard vnto it, if God his vnappeaſeable wrath breake out againſt it, for its ſinnes.</q>
            </p>
            <p>For confirmation of this doctrine, I need not ſend you to the <hi>old world,</hi> to behold the <hi>ruines</hi> of cities there. There may you ſee the <hi>city</hi> which <hi>Caine</hi> built, (Gen. 4.17.) and whatſoever other <hi>cities</hi> were erected betweene that time, and the floud; you may ſee them all ſwept away with the floud. After the floud you may ſee <hi>Sodom,</hi> and <hi>Gomorah,</hi> with other <hi>cities</hi> of that plaine; overthrowne with brimſtone, &amp; fire fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the LORD out of Heaven, Gen. 19.24. I need not preſent you with other like deſolations of <hi>cities, townes,</hi> or <hi>villages,</hi> wrought by Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God in the daies of old.</p>
            <p>This one chapter, &amp; firſt chapter of this prophecy of <hi>Amos,</hi> yeelds vnto vs plentifull proofe for this point. Here haue we ſeene deſolation vpon deſolation, not the ſhaking only, but the overthrow of foure ſtates; namely of the <hi>Syrians,</hi> of the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtines,</hi> of the <hi>Tyrians,</hi> and of the <hi>Edomites.</hi> In the ſtate of the <hi>Syrians,</hi> we haue ſeene the ruines of <hi>the houſe of</hi> Hazael, <hi>and of the palaces of</hi> Ben-hadad, and of <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> and of <hi>Bikeath-A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> and of <hi>Beth-eden,</hi> and of <hi>Aram,</hi> verſ. 4.5.

            </p>
            <p>One vſe of this doctrine, is, to leſſon vs, that wee put not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny confidence in any <hi>worldly helpe;</hi> but that ſo wee vſe all good meanes of our defenſe, that ſtill wee rely vpon the LORD, for ſtrength, and ſucceſſe thereby.</p>
            <p>A ſecond vſe, is, to put vs in mind of the <hi>feareful puniſhments which God layeth vpon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

            <p>If the ſecure worldling ſhall here obiect, that our daies, are the daies of <hi>peace,</hi> that our King, is a King of <hi>peace,</hi> that <hi>peace</hi> is in all our ports, in all our quarters, in all our dwelling places; and that therefore there is no need to feare the <hi>ſubverſion</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of our <hi>cities,</hi> or of our <hi>villages:</hi> to ſuch I muſt anſwer in the Prophet Eſaies wordes, chap. 48.22. <hi>There is</hi>

            <p>This is it which before I noted: namely, that, <hi>It's neither care nor policie, that can ſtay Gods revengefull hand, when hee bringeth fire in it:</hi> as here it's threatned vnto <hi>Rabbah: I will kindle a fire in the wall of</hi> Rabbah.

            </p>
            <p>And it was grounded vpon theſe words: <hi>I will kindle a fire in the wall of</hi> Rabbah.</p>
            <p>It's further added of this <hi>fire,</hi> that it <hi>ſhall devoure the palaces of</hi> Rabbah. Which branch repeated in each of the precedent prophecies (as verſ. 4, 7, 10, 12.) hath formerly yeelded vs this doctrine.</p>

            <p>For proofe of this truth let vs looke into the word of truth. In the 26. of Levitic. ver. 25. thus ſaith the LORD vnto <hi>Iſrael: If ye walke ſtubbornly againſt me; &amp; will not obey me, then I will ſend a ſword vpon you, that ſhall avenge the quarrell of my couenant.</hi>

            <q>The deſtruction of the wicked commeth ſuddainely vpon them.</q>
            <p>This truth is a vowed by <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 37.2. Where to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the <hi>godly</hi> not to fret, or hee grieved at the proſperitie of the <hi>wicked,</hi> he brings this reaſon: <hi>They ſhall ſoone be cut downe like graſſe, and ſhall wither as the greene hearbe:</hi> which in other words, verſ. 20. of the ſame Pſalme, he thus delivereth: <hi>They ſhal periſh, and ſhall hee conſumed, as the fat of lambes; even with the ſmoake ſhall they conſume away. They ſhall be conſumed at the fat of lambes:]</hi> there is vtter deſtruction for them; <hi>they ſhall bee conſumed as ſmoake]</hi> there is the ſuddenneſſe of their deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>The ſtate of the wicked is very tickliſh, and vncertaine. For as it is, Pſal. 73.18. God hath <hi>ſet them in ſlipperie places, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth them downe into deſolation.</hi> Their end is there deſcribed to be wonderfull, ſuddaine, and fearefull; <hi>Quomodo vaſtabuntur?

            <p>
               <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeakes to this purpoſe, as plainly as may be, Prov. 6.15. <hi>The deſtruction of the wicked ſhall come ſpeedily: he ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed ſuddenly without recoverie.

               </gap> would rent from <hi>Solomon</hi> the kingdome of Iſrael, <hi>becauſe he forſooke the</hi> LORD <hi>and worſhipped</hi> Milchom, <hi>the God of the Ammonites.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You ſee what <hi>Melchom</hi> is. It is the <hi>God</hi> of the <hi>Ammonites;</hi> not the <hi>true God;</hi> for he is the <hi>God of all the world;</hi> but the <hi>God of the Ammonites;</hi> an <hi>abomination,</hi> an <hi>Idole.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet did they worſhip it. But how? <hi>Moſes</hi> tels you, Deut. 12.31. <hi>They burnt their ſonnes and daughters with fire, and offered them to their Gods.</hi> This abomination of the <hi>Painyme</hi> nations, hatefull to the <hi>living God,</hi> ſpread it ſelfe, even to the corrupting of the Lords people. For to the <hi>children of Iſrael,</hi> &amp; to the <hi>chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iudah,</hi> it is obiected, Ier. 32.35. That <hi>they built the high places of</hi> Baal, <hi>which are in the valley of</hi> Ben-hinnom, <hi>to cauſe their ſonnes, and their daughters to paſſe through the fire of</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lech. And the expoſtulation of God with the houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zech. 20.30. laies this home vnto them: <hi>Are yee not polluted af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:1729:131"/> the manner of your fathers? Commit yee not whoredome after their abominations? For when you offer your gifts, and make your ſonnes to paſſe through the fire, you pollute your ſelues with your</hi> I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols.</p>
            <p>It is regiſtred among the praiſes of good <hi>king Ioſiah,</hi> 2. King. 23.10. that <hi>he defiled</hi> (or put downe, and deſtroied) <hi>Topheth, which was in the valley of the children of</hi> Hinnom, <hi>that no man ſhould make his ſonne, or his daughter, paſſe through the fire of</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lech.</p>
            <p>By this which hath beene ſpoken, you ſee what <hi>Melchom</hi> is &amp; how it was worſhipped. An <hi>Idole-God</hi> worſhipped with the effuſion of the bloud of innocents; mens ſonnes and daughters were conſecrated vnto it through fire.</p>
            <p>So haue you two readings of my text: one, <hi>Their king ſhall go into captivity, he, and his Princes together:</hi> the other, <hi>Melchom ſhall go into captivity, &amp;c.</hi> Let vs now ſee, what profitable do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines may be taken from either, for our further inſtruction, &amp; the reformation of our liues.</p>
            <p>The firſt reading is according to the Hebrew, <hi>Their king ſhal go into captivity, he, and his Princes together:</hi> according to the Septuagint, <hi>Their king ſhall go into captivity, their Prieſts, and Princes likewiſe.</hi> The doctrine ariſing hence is,
<q>When God puniſheth a nation with captivity for their ſinnes, he spareth neither Prieſt, nor Prince, nor King.</q>
            </p>
            <p>That <hi>captivity</hi> is an effect, or puniſhment of ſin, I haue here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore made plaine vnto you, in my 11. Lecture vpon this firſt chapter of <hi>Amos. Salomon</hi> ſaith it, 1. King. 8 46. <hi>When a people ſinneth againſt the</hi> LORD, <hi>and the</hi> LORD <hi>is angry with them, the</hi> LORD <hi>delivereth them vp to be caried away priſoners into the la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of their enimies.</hi> It is affirmed, 1. Chron. 9.1. That the <hi>Iſraelites were caried away to</hi> Babylon <hi>for their tranſgreſſions.</hi> And Deut. 28.41. among <hi>the curſes</hi> threatned to ſuch, as will not obey the voice of the LORD their God, <hi>Captivity</hi> is reckoned. <hi>Thou ſhalt beget ſonnes, and daughters, but ſhalt not haue them: for they ſhall goe into captivity.</hi> Looke backe but to the fifth verſe of this chapter: there ſhall you finde it denounced againſt the people

King 4.25</note> vnder his vine, and vnder his figgetree, to liue in our owne land in peace, free from all feare of being led into <hi>captivity.</hi> Thus much of my firſt vſe.</p>
            <p>A ſecond followeth. My doctrine was,
<q>When God puniſheth a nation with captivity for their ſinnes, hee ſpareth neither Prieſt, nor Prince, nor King.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Will you haue a reaſon hereof? Heare then what <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaith, Iob 34.19. <hi>God accepteth not the perſons of Princes, he regardeth not the rich, more then the poore? He accepteth no mans perſon</hi> ſaith <hi>S. Paule,</hi> Gal. 2.6. <hi>No mans perſon?</hi> Then neither the <hi>perſon</hi> of the <hi>Prieſt,</hi> nor of the <hi>Prince,</hi> nor of the <hi>King.</hi> If theſe <hi>ſinne</hi> like others of the people, theſe ſhal be <hi>puniſhed,</hi> as wel as others; and if others be <hi>caried into captivity,</hi> theſe muſt <hi>into captivity</hi> alſo.</p>
            <p>The vſe of this doctrine is to admoniſh the great, &amp; mightie ones of this world, that they preſume not to ſinne againſt the LORD, as if they were priviledged by their greatnes, &amp; might. No priviledge can ſerue their turnes, when they muſt<note n="e" place="margin">Iob 21.20.</note> 
               <hi>drinke of the wrath of the Almighty.</hi> Then ſhall they be <hi>as</hi>
               <note n="f" place="margin">Iob 21.18.</note> 
               <hi>ſtubble before the winde, and as the chaffe, that the ſtorme carieth away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Conſider this all yee, who take your ſelues to bee mightie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong your neighbours; yee, whom God hath bleſſed with this worlds good aboue your neighbours. Thinke not, your wealth or authority can protect you, when Gods ſore diſpleaſure ſhall breake out againſt you for your ſinnes: but rather let it ever be written in your hearts, what is written, Wiſd. 6.6. <hi>The mighty ſhall be mightily tormented.</hi> And remember what is added in that place: <hi>He that is Lord over all, will ſpare no perſon, neither ſhal he feare any greatnes: for he hath made the ſmall, and the great, and
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:1729:134"/> careth for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

               </gap> vſe.</p>
            <p>It is to miniſter a word of comfort to the inferiour, and poo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer ſort of people. If the mighty ſhall<note n="g" place="margin">Amos 2.6.</note>

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort: God, the iudge of al, accepteth no perſons. He in his good time will avenge your cauſes, bee your oppreſſours never ſo mightie; for <hi>when he puniſheth a land for the ſinnes of a people, he spareth neither Prieſt, nor Prince, nor King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is a fourth vſe of this doctrine. It is to warne vs not to ſet our hearts vpon the outwarde things of this worlde, for as much as God will not reſpect vs for them. Neither <hi>Prieſt,</hi> nor <hi>Prince,</hi> nor <hi>King,</hi> can ſtand before the diſpleaſure of Almightie God. And ſhall a mighty man, ſhall a rich man ſtand? No.<note n="l" place="margin">Pſal. 68.2.</note> 
               <hi>As the ſmoake vaniſheth, ſo ſhall he be driven away;</hi> and as <hi>the waxe melteth before the fire; ſo ſhall he periſh at the preſence of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore (dearely beloved in the LORD) let vs only, and earneſtly ſeeke after ſuch things, as may make vs accepted with God; as <hi>righteouſneſſe, peace,</hi> and <hi>ioy in the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> For who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever in theſe things ſerveth <hi>Chriſt,</hi> hee is <hi>acceptable to God.</hi> ſaith S. Paule, Rom. 14.18. Thus farre by occaſion of my firſt doctrine: which was,
<q>When God puniſheth a nation with captivitie for their ſinnes, he ſpareth neither prieſt, nor prince, nor king.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And it was grounded vpon the firſt reading of the words of my text; after the Hebrew thus, <hi>Their King ſhall goe into capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitie, he, &amp; his princes together:</hi> after the Septuagint thus, <hi>Their Kings ſhall goe into captivitie, their prieſts, and Princes likewiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I commended vnto you another reading out of the Vulgar Latin: Melchom <hi>ſhall goe into captivitie, he, and his princes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi> &amp; I told you in the beginning of this exerciſe what <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chom was.</hi> I ſaid it was the ſame with <hi>Milchom,</hi> or <hi>Molech,</hi> or <hi>Moloch;</hi> an <hi>abomination</hi> of the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> their <hi>Idol,</hi> their <hi>God,</hi> to whom they yeelded <hi>divine worſhip,</hi> &amp; conſecrated their
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:1729:134"/> children through fire. All this I made plaine vnto you out of the ſacred Scriptures. The doctrine,
<q>Neither <hi>Melchom</hi> of the Ammonites, nor any other Idol of any other people, can ſaue themſelues in the day of captivity, much leſſe can they ſaue the people; that doe truſt in them, &amp; worſhip them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>they cannot ſaue themſelues.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>nor them, that put their truſt in them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>They cannot ſaue themſelues.</hi> For what is become of <hi>Succoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>benoth</hi> the God of <hi>Babel?</hi> of <hi>Nergal,</hi> the God of <hi>Cuth;</hi> of <hi>Aſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> the God of <hi>Hamath?</hi> of <hi>Nibhaz</hi> and <hi>Tartack,</hi> the God of the <hi>Avims?</hi> of <hi>Adrammelach,</hi> and <hi>Anammelech,</hi> the God of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pharvaim?</hi> Their names indeed remaine vpon record, 2. King. 17.30, 31. but the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues are vaniſhed, they are come to nought. <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> King of <hi>Iudah,</hi> hee who brake in pieces the braſen ſerpent, which <hi>Moſes</hi> made, becauſe his people offered incenſe to it, he put downe thoſe Idol Gods; hee <hi>tooke away their high places,</hi> he <hi>brake their images,</hi> he <hi>cut downe their groues,</hi> 2. King. 18.4.</p>
            <p>What is become of <hi>Aſhtoreth</hi> the Idol of the <hi>Zidonians?</hi> of <hi>Chemoſh</hi> the Idol of the <hi>Moabites?</hi> of <hi>Milchom</hi> the abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the children of <hi>Ammon?</hi> Their names indeed remaine vpon record, 2. King. 23.13. but themſelues are vaniſhed, they are come to nought. <hi>Ioſiah,</hi> King of <hi>Iudah,</hi> that good King, hee put downe thoſe <hi>Idol Gods,</hi> he <hi>brake their images in pieces,</hi> hee <hi>cut downe their groues,</hi> and <hi>filled their places with the bones of men,</hi> 2. King. 23.14.</p>
            <p>I could here repeat vnto you many other <hi>Idols</hi> &amp; <hi>Idol Gods,</hi> whoſe names are particularly recorded in the regiſter of Gods holy word, which alſo are vaniſhed, and come to nought. But the time wil not ſuffer me. Let it ſuffice, what is ſpoken in a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralitie of the Kings of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> 2. Kings, 19.18. that they did <hi>ſet on fire the Gods of the nations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gods?</hi> And yet <hi>ſet on fire?</hi> True. But they were but <hi>Idol Gods;</hi> and therefore could not helpe themſelues. Not helpe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues? Why not? The reaſon is given in the ſame place: <hi>for they
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:1729:135"/> were no Gods,</hi> (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Idol God is no God) <hi>they were no Gods, but the worke of mans hands, even wood and ſtone:</hi> therefore <hi>the kings of Aſſyria deſtroyed them.</hi> The very ſame reaſon is delivered in the very ſame wordes, by the Prophet Eſai, chap. 37.19. <hi>They were no Gods, but the worke of mens hands, even wood and ſtone, therefore the Kings of Aſſyria deſtroyed them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The holy Prophets are very zealous in Gods cauſe againſt thoſe Idols.

            <p>But what profit had they of ſuch their worſhip? Found they any helpe in the day of viſitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? No. Thoſe Images themſelues could not helpe themſelues; &amp; how then could they help their worſhippers? Themſelues were broken downe, and removed from out our <hi>churches;</hi> &amp; their worſhippers are removed with them.

            </p>

            </p>
            <p>Thus is our <hi>ſubſtance</hi> an <hi>Idol:</hi> if as <hi>Iob</hi> ſpeaketh, chap. 31.25. <hi>We reioice, becauſe it is great, or becauſe our hand hath gotten much.</hi> Like thoſe, Habak. 1.16. <hi>Who did ſacrifice to their nets, &amp; burne incenſe to their flues:</hi> where all they are taxed for <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> who becauſe their portion is encreaſed, and their meale plenteous by ſuch <hi>inſtruments,</hi> and <hi>helps,</hi> as they vſe in their trades of life, do forget the right <hi>authour</hi> of their wealth, &amp; ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate all to themſelues, and their ſerviceable meanes.</p>
            <pb n="263" facs="tcp:1729:136"/>
            <p>Thus is our <hi>wit,</hi> and <hi>vnderſtanding</hi> an <hi>Idol,</hi> when we aſcribe vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, our getting of riches, of gold, &amp; ſilver into our trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, like the prince of <hi>Tyrus,</hi> Ezech. 28.2. who with this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite exalted in heart, brake out into that moſt blaſphemous challenge: <hi>I am a God, and I ſit in the ſeate of God in the middeſt of the ſea.</hi> Such is the <hi>Idol</hi> of the <hi>Polititians</hi> (ſhall I call them? or Atheiſts) of this age: who take themſelues to be wiſer then <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,</hi> as the prince of <hi>Tyrus</hi> did: and are perſwaded that <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> are not ſo able to inſtruct them, as they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.</p>
            <p>Thus is our <hi>ſtrength</hi> an <hi>Idol,</hi> if we boaſt of it, as <hi>Sennacherib</hi> did, Eſai. 37.24. who bragged what great matters he had done <hi>by the multitude of his chariots;</hi> but touching the true LORD <hi>of hoaſts,</hi> as if he were leſſe then nothing, he vau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth to <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> king of <hi>Iudah,</hi> verſ. 10. <hi>Let not thy God deceiue thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus is our <hi>belly</hi> our <hi>God,</hi> when walking after the luſts of our fleſh, we <hi>ſerue not the</hi> LORD <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> but <hi>our owne bellies:</hi> as <hi>S.

            <p>Hath the LORD ſaid it, and ſhall he not do it? Hath he ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it, and ſhall he not accompliſh it? The LORD, IEHOVAH, the ſtrength of <hi>Iſrael</hi> is not as man, that he ſhould lie, nor as the ſonne of man, that he ſhould repent.

IEHOVAH, the LORD ſaith, whatſoever our Prophet <hi>Amos</hi> hath here denounced againſt the <hi>Ammonites.</hi> It is the LORD that ſaith it: <hi>Amos</hi> is but the LORDS Miniſter; the words are the LORDS. Whence we may take this doctrine,
<q>The author of holy Scripture, is neither man, nor Angel, nor any other creature, how excellent ſoever, but only the living and immortall God.</q>
